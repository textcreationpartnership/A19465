            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng the order and forme of an appeale perteyneth to the lawyers, wherof I my ≈øelf am ignorant, and ≈øeing that Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers appeale co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>meth not to my hand: I purpo≈øed to break my mind in this matter to ≈øome faithful fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d &amp; ≈økilful in the law, who≈øe helpe I myght v≈øe in thys behalf, and you only among other came to my remembraunce as a man mo≈øte meete in this vniuer≈øitye for that purpo≈øe. But this is a matter that requyreth great ≈øilence, ≈øo that no man knowe of it before it bee done. It is ≈øo that I am ≈øu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>moned to make myne aun≈øwer at Rome, the .xvi. day of this moneth, before the which daye I thynke it good after ≈øentence pronounced to make mine appeale. But whether I ≈øhould fyr≈øt appeale from the iudge delegate to the Pope, and ≈øo afterwarde to the generall coun≈øell, or elles leauyng the Pope, I ≈øhoulde appeale immediatly to the coun≈øell: herein I ≈øtand in neede of your coun≈øell.

Be≈øides this, where as I vtterly re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fu≈øed to make aun≈øwere to the articles obiected vnto me by the bi≈øhop of Glouce≈øter appointed by the Pope to bee my iudge, yet I was content to aun≈øwer Martyn and Story, with this prote≈øtation, that mine an≈øwer ≈øhould not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as made before a iudge, nor yet in place of iudgement, but as pertayning nothing to iudgement at al: and moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer after I had made mine aun≈øwere I required to haue a copy of the ≈øame, that I might, either by addyng therunto, by alteryng or takyng from it, correcte and amend it, as I thought good.

yet haue they altogether broken promi≈øe with me, and haue not permitted me to correct my ≈øayde aun≈øweres ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordinge to my reque≈øt, and yet notwith≈øtandyng haue (as I vnder≈øtande) rege≈øtred the ≈øame as actes formally done in place of iudgemente. Finallye fora≈ømuch as all thys my trouble commeth vpon my departinge from the by≈øhop of Rome and from the popi≈øhe religion, ≈øo that nowe the quarel is betwixte the Pope him≈øelfe and me, and no man can be a lawfull and indifferente iudge in his owne cau≈øe: it ≈øeemeth (me thinke) good rea≈øon that I ≈øhould be ≈øuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to appeale to ≈øome generall coun≈øell in thys matter: ≈øpeciallye ≈øeinge the lawe of nature (as they ≈øaye) denyeth no man, the remedye of appeale in ≈øuch ca≈øes.

How ioyful it was to vs to heare the reporte of D. Taylor &amp; of his godly confe≈ø≈øion &amp;c: I en≈øure you, it is hard for me to expre≈ø≈øe. Ble≈ø≈øed be God which was and is the geuer of that and all godly ≈øtrength and ≈øtomacke in the time of aduer≈øity. As for the rumors that haue or doe go abroade either of our relenting or ma≈ø≈øing, we tru≈øt that they which know god and theyr dutye towardes theyr bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in Chri≈øt, wil not be to lyght of credit to beleue them. It is not the ≈øclaunderers euell tounge but a mans owne euell deede, that can with God defile a man, and therfore by gods grace, you ≈øhal neuer haue cau≈øe to doe otherwi≈øe then you ≈øay you do, that is not to doubt but that we will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, &amp;c.

We are in good health thankes be to God, &amp; yet the manner of our entreting doth chaung as ≈øoure ale doth in ≈øo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mer. It is reported to vs of our kepers, that the vniuer≈øity beareth vs heauely. A cole chaunced to fal in the night out of the chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney &amp; burnt a hole in the floore, &amp; no more harme was done, the balifes ≈øeruants ≈øitting by the fyer.

For yf ye thynke ye can inwardly in the hart ≈øerue hym, and yet outwardlye ≈øerue wyth the worlde in externall ≈øeruyce, the thyng that is not GOD, ye deceaue youre ≈øelues, for bothe the bodye and the ≈øoule mu≈øte to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether concurre in the honoure of God, as Saynte Paule playnlye teacheth. 1. <hi>Cor</hi> 6.

               <p>As concerning the party whom you wrote vnto me of, I haue here ≈øent you mine adui≈øe, and what I thynke is be≈øte in this ca≈øe to be done. Fyr≈øte ≈øhe ≈øhall remember the coun≈øell of S. Paule. 1. Cor. 7. where he ≈øpeaketh to ≈øuche as be cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled in matrimoy and be of two ≈øundry and diuers religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: If the vnbeleuinge man will dwell with the faythfull woman, the wife cannot for≈øake him. Or in ca≈øe the vnbele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing woman wil dwell with her beleuing hu≈øband, the hu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band cannot for≈øake her. But if the vnbeleuing party (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be hu≈øband or wife) will departe, the beleuing partye is at libertye. Now in this time, to beleue that the prie≈øt can make God, or to beleue that which was not God ye≈øterday, can be both God and man to daye, &amp; ≈øo to honor that which was but very bread ye≈øterdaye, for the true God that made both heauen and earth and al that be in them, and for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ≈øoule of Chri≈øte that ≈øuffred for oure redemption, and toke from vs our ≈øinnes vpon the cro≈ø≈øe: is very idolatry &amp; to be committed of no chri≈øtian man, for the payne of it with out repentance, is euerla≈øting dampnation. In matrimonie it is mete therefore, that which partye ≈øo euer be per≈øwaded &amp; knoweth the truth, be it the hu≈øband or the wife, the truth be ≈øpoken, taught, and opend vnto the party that is not per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>≈øwaded. For as Saint Paule ≈øayeth: howe knowe≈øt thou O man, whether thou ≈øhalt ≈øaue thy wife, or how knowe≈øt thou O woman, whether thou ≈øhalt ≈øaue thy hu≈øband. Therefore let the be≈øt and more godly partye be diligent in ≈øauinge (by his or her laboures) the party that is not in≈øtructed nor per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>≈øwaded in the truth. If it preuayle, then is the wor≈øe part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, and the be≈øt part hath done his or her duty and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as it is commaunded. <hi>Ephe≈øi.</hi> 4. <hi>Collo≈øs.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>In ca≈øe the wor≈øe part will not be amended, but tary ≈øtill in errour, and ≈øo offend the almighty God the author of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, let the be≈øte parte that is per≈øwaded and knoweth the

Arte thou ≈øo ≈øone wery of the heauenly Manna and ≈øo readye to returne to thy olde vomite agayne? we thought thou hadde≈øt beene ≈øo cleane e≈øcaped through the woorde of grace, that thou hadde≈øt bene a worthy man, to be a comforte to them that ≈øtand, a ≈øuccour to the weake, and an helpe to them that fall: and art thou now roled in thy filthye pudle agayn, and art become an helper to put other into the ≈øame? Oh more then damnable doings, the forgeuenes wherof farre pa≈ø≈øeth the hope of man. And were it not that things impo≈ø≈øible to man are po≈ø≈øible with God, we ≈øhoulde vtterly de≈øpayre of thy returne. But knowing that with God there is no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈ø≈øibilitie, we wil not only aduerty≈øe thee to remember fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> whence thou arte fallen, that thou maye≈øt ≈øeeke to ry≈øe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, but we will al≈øo praye that he to whom thy returne is po≈ø≈øible, will vouch≈øafe of hys infinite mercyes to worke it in thee. Thou ha≈øte with Iudas ≈øolde thy mo≈øte louyng and gentle Mai≈øter: repente thee Peter and no doubte thou ≈øhalt fynde mercye. To fall is a thing annexed to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupte nature of man, but to lye ≈øtill in the filthye puddle of perdition, is to de≈øpi≈øe God the authour and fyr≈øt maker of nature. To fall into the darkenes of errour is a poynte of mans ignoraunce: but to walke on ≈øtil in darkenes, is to loue darkenes more then lyghte. To wyncke at the bryght<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe of the Sunne, is a weakenes of the eyes, but to flye the light is to be of the nyght. To leaue the rough way that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vnto lyfe, and walke in the plea≈øaunt waye that leadeth vnto perdition, is to loue thys lyfe: but not to leaue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> waye when we are warned, is to de≈øpi≈øe the lyfe to come.

Concerning thys life, you knowe that it is full of mi≈øerye, vanitie and woe: it is a playne exile and hath nothing in it permanente.

Daniells denne is not ≈øo dreadfull as is this dongeon we dwell in.</p>
               <p>Concerning death to them that be (as I knowe you are) Gods deare children, my tenderlye beloued ≈øi≈øter, what other thynge is it then the di≈øpatcher of all di≈øplea≈øure, the ende of al trauaile, the doore of de≈øires, the gate of gladnes, the porte of parady≈øe, the hauen of heauen, the rayle of re≈øte and quietnes, the entraunce to felicitie, the beginnyng of all bli≈øfulnes.

It is a pa≈ø≈øage to the Father, a chariot to heauen, the Lordes me≈ø≈øenger, a leader vnto Chri≈øt, a going to oure home, a deliueraunce from bondage and pri≈øon, a dimi≈ø≈øion from warre, a ≈øecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie from all ≈øorrowes, and a manumi≈ø≈øion from all mi≈øerye.

and ≈øhould we be di≈ømayde at it? Shoulde we be a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>frayde of it? Should we tremble to heare of it? Should ≈øuch a frend as it is, be vnwelcome?

               <p>Concerning that which is prepared for you after death, if I ≈øhoulde go about to expre≈ø≈øe it, the more I ≈øhould ≈øo do, the further I ≈øhould be from it. For the eye hath not ≈øeene, neither the eare hath heard, nor the harte of man is able to conceaue in any poynte, the ioye, myrth, melodye, plea≈øure, power, welth, riches, honour, beautie, fellow≈øhippe, deyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, odours, glorye, wi≈øedome, knowledge, threa≈øures, ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie, peace, quietnes and eternall felicitie, which you ≈øhal haue and enioye world without ende, with God y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Father, the Sonne, and the holy Gho≈øt, with the Aungels, Archan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, with the Patriarckes and Prophetes, with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtles and Euangeli≈øtes, with the Martyrs and Confe≈ø≈øors, and with all the Saintes of God in the Palace of the Lorde in heauen, the kingdome of God, the glorye of the Father.

But graunt them theyr rea≈øon, that it is good. What ≈øhould Antioche clayme?

But what and if a man ≈øhould by probable coniectures ≈øhewe, that it is but a fable, which is fayned of Peters Bi≈øhoprike at Rome? Read how Paule doth ≈øalute very many priuate per≈øons when he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to the Romaines. Three yeres after hys Epi≈øtle made, he was brought to Rome pri≈øoner.

               <p>Now for the relentyng, returning, &amp; recantyng of ≈øome from that whiche they once profe≈ø≈øed or preached: alas, who would wonder at it? for they neuer came to the go≈øpell but for commodity &amp; gaines ≈øake, and now for gaine they leaue it.

                  </hi> the re≈øtorer and reformer of all thynges that be both in heauen &amp; in earth, and with the argument which.

on that fort. Neyther dare I ≈øaye that the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaketh here hyperbotically or exce≈ø≈øiuely: although ≈øome thinke ≈øo. But as I ≈øayd, I ≈øay agayn, that the Apo≈øtle doth here ≈øim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply affirme, that there ≈øhall be a renouacion &amp; a deliuerance from corruption, not only of man, but al≈øo of al and of euery part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole world: of euery part (I ≈øay) meaning partes in deede, &amp; not ≈øuch as be rather vices &amp; added for plagues, then for partes.

               <p>Thys renouation of all things, the Prophets do ≈øeme to promy≈øe, when they promi≈øe new heauens &amp; new earth: For a newe earth ≈øeemeth to require no le≈ø≈øe renouation of earthly thinges, then new heauens do of heauenly thyngs.

                  </hi> Therfore me thinkes it is the dutye of a Godly minde, ≈øim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to acknowledge, and therof to bragge in the Lord, that in our re≈øurrection al things ≈øhal be ≈øo repayred to eternitie, as for our ≈øinne they were made ≈øubiecte to corruption.</p>
               <p>The auncient writers our of Peter, haue, as it were,<note place="margin">2. <hi>pet.</hi> 3</note> agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this ≈øentence, that the ≈øhape of this world ≈øhall pa≈ø≈øe a way through the burning of earthly fire, as it was drowned wyth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flowing of earthly waters.<note place="margin">Augu≈øt. de ciuitate dei lib. cap. <hi>6</hi>

               <p>But Thomas Aquinas entreateth thys que≈øtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly or rather curiou≈ølye, affyrming the cele≈øtial bodies, the elementes &amp; mankinde to be renewed: but in no wi≈øe bea≈øts plantes &amp;c. to bee ≈øo: and this is hys principall rea≈øon. The renouation of the world ≈øhal be for man: therfore ≈øuch ≈øhall be the renouation as ≈øhal be conformable to the renouation of man. But the renouation, of man ≈øhal be from corruption to incorruption: fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> mouing to re≈øt: the things therfore that ≈øhall be renewed with man, mu≈øt be broughte al≈øo to incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. Now, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cele≈øtial bodies &amp; the elementes were made to incorruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>: the one wholy &amp; in euery part, the other, that is the elementes, though in part they are corruptible, yet co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole, they are incorruptible, as man is incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>cerning part, that is the ≈øoule. But bea≈øts, pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tes &amp;c. are corruptible both wholy &amp; in euery part: therefore they were not made to incorruption, and ≈øo are they not confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the renewing, that is, they are not receaueable of incorruption, and therfore they ≈øhall not be re≈øtored.</p>
               <p>This rea≈øon is true in this part, that it affirmeth thyngs ≈øhal be re≈øtored with man, and w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him ≈øhal be brought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuitie, &amp; as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apo≈øtle ≈øayth, to be deliuered from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bondage of corruption. Agayne, hys rea≈øon is true herein al≈øo, that mans rea≈øon may ≈øoner be per≈øuaded y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things now partly incorruptible, ≈øhal be re≈øtored altogether to incorruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>. But now to ≈øay that by no rea≈øon tho≈øe things may be broughte to perpetuitie, which now both wholy &amp; partly be te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>porall and momentane, howe can he proue it? in that the nature &amp; being of all thyngs, dependeth on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> omnipotencie of God, which after hys own plea≈øure doth geue to things which he hath made, their being, and al is one to him, to make a thing temporall and to make it eternall. For he made all thynges of nothing: and therefore heauen and the cele≈øtiall bodyes haue no more of them ≈øelues that they be perpetuall, then haue tho≈øe thinges that la≈øte but a daye. Wherfore, thys rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon which Thomas maketh, is not fyrme, in that it wholye leaueth to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which now ≈øeemeth and appeareth in thynges. In deede (as I ≈øaid) it hath ≈øome ≈øhewe or probabilitie, that

the≈øe things ≈øhal be renewed to eternitie for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glory of gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, which now ≈øomthyng are pertakers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ≈øame. But now, ≈øeing that both it which they nowe haue, and al≈øo ≈øhall haue, dependeth vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> becke &amp; plea≈øure of God, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> hath God made of coun≈øell with hym concerning the renouation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world &amp; of al things, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he can tel what partes of things &amp; what kindes of things he wil renewe? Yea euen Ari≈øtotle dyd acknowledge that <hi>Phy≈øice</hi> or natural knowlege, becau≈øe it bringeth his rea≈øons fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> di≈øpo≈øition &amp; nature of things, hath not ful nece≈ø≈øitie of his rea≈øons.

Who may make God ≈øubiecte to hys worke? Can not he that made all things of nothyng, geue hereafter to the thinges that he hath made, that wherof nowe in them ≈øelues they haue no capacitie?</p>
               <p>The≈øe thyngs I do therfore rehear≈øe, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end I myghte declare, that when we di≈øpute what god wyl do concernyng hys workes, how that it is not ≈øeemely for vs to conclude according to that which ≈øemeth &amp; appeareth to vs in things, but rather as godlyne≈ø≈øe requireth, to referre all thynges to the wil of God.

But if it be not ≈øo, then ought we frely to confe≈ø≈øe our ignoraunce, and not pre≈øcribe to God what he ought to doe of hys workes, by that which alreadye he hath done.

               <p>The fore≈øayd Thomas bringeth forth al≈øo other rea≈øons, but which he hym ≈øelfe counteth not for inuincible.

no rea≈øon why the≈øe ≈øhoulde be re≈øtored more then other: therefore ≈øaith he, they ≈øhal not be re≈øtored. But here, what would he aun≈øwere, if one ≈øhoulde a≈øke him howe he knoweth it is not conuenient that eyther al in number bee re≈øtored, as ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> ≈øhal ary≈øe, eyther only ≈øome, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thys thing wholye re≈øteth in the hand and wil of God? An other rea≈øon he maketh out of Ari≈øtotle, and out of a grounde whiche is vncertayne. Ari≈øtotle affyrmeth the perpetuitie of thinges to hang on the continual mouing of heauen. Thomas now hereto gathereth thus: but the mouing of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> ≈øhall cea≈øe: therfore he concludeth that in the≈øe inferiour things no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuitie maye be looked for. But here, what an≈øwere wil he make, if a man ≈øhall ≈øay that all thynges hange at the becke and plea≈øure of God, who nowe for the con≈øeruation of his creatures, whiche now ary≈øe and ≈øpring, and nowe dye and fall downe: v≈øeth the mouyng of heauen, and can after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes not v≈øe it for thys purpo≈øe? Thys is a truth, that all thynges of them ≈øelues are nothyng: muche more then can they not doe any thyng. Now, men may coniecture that the mouyng of heauen ≈øhall cea≈øe, but yet by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> certaine word of God, they can not proue it. In like manner is hys la≈øte rea≈øon which he maketh of the ende of bea≈øtes and plantes, but which end he knoweth not. Bea≈øtes and plantes ≈øayth he, were made for the ≈øu≈øtentation of the mutual life of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, but thys lyfe ≈øhall cea≈øe, therefore ≈øhall they al≈øo. But here hath he no aun≈øweare if a man ≈øhoulde demaunde, who knoweth whether GOD haue made them to none other ende or v≈øe?</p>
               <p>Seing therfore the≈øe thynges be as you ≈øee, I ≈øuppo≈øe it not to pertayne to a godly man, to denye the bea≈øtes and pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tes to be re≈øtored, in that the Apo≈øtle doth here expre≈ø≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øay, that euery creature which is now ≈øubiecte to vanitie, ≈øhal bee deliuered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of god.

but gods worde. Therfore it is the parte of a godlye man, and of one that hangeth in all thynges vppon the worde of god, to learne out of thys place, that what≈øoeuer corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, deathe, or griefe he ≈øeeth in anye thyng, where≈øoeuer it bee, that (I ≈øaye) he a≈øcribe that wholye vnto hys ≈øynnes, and thereby prouoke hym≈øelfe to true repentaunce. Nowe as ≈øoone as that repentaunce compelleth hym to goe to Chri≈øte, lette hym thynke thus: but thys my Sauiour, and my head Ie≈øus Chri≈øt dyd for my ≈øynnes, and therewith, as he toke away death, ≈øo hath he taken away all the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and labour of all thynges, and wyll re≈øtore them in his tyme, whether ≈øo euer they be in heauen or in earthe. Now euery creature trauayleth and groneth wyth vs, but we be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>yng re≈øtored, they al≈øo ≈øhalbe re≈øtored. There ≈øhall be newe heauens, newe earth, and all thynges newe,</p>
               <p>Thus I wy≈øhe that our myndes myght ≈øtaye in thys generalitye of the renouation of the worlde, and not curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øly to ≈øearche what partes of the worlde ≈øhalbe re≈øtored, and what ≈øhall not, or how al thyngs ≈øhalbe re≈øtored: much more then I would not haue vs curious nor inqui≈øitiue of theyr place where they ≈øhall be, of theyr action what they ≈øhall doe, or of theyr properties and ≈øuche lyke. For if, to haue fore knowen the≈øe thynges, woulde haue made muche to godlines, ≈øurely the holy gho≈øt woulde mo≈øte playnely haue tolde them. For accordyng to chri≈øtes promi≈øe he brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vs into all truth, all truth (I ≈øaye) ≈øuche as the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it would profite vs. Al the ≈øcripture is geuen to vs for this purpo≈øe that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man of god might be made perfect, and en≈øtructed to al good workes: and truely that can be no good worke, which we do, except god teach vs the ≈øame.

                  </hi> But the certayne and bottomles fountayne of the≈øe good workes is, in all thynges to hange on the becke and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure of god, and throughe our Lorde Ie≈øus Chri≈øt, to looke for, with remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øynnes, lyfe euerla≈øtyng, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye of the re≈øurrection.

For concernyng our re≈øurrection, what other thyng do we knowe before hand, but that we ≈øhall be mo≈øt happy? euen ≈øo therfore let vs not doubt but that there ≈øhall be a deliueraunce of the creature from the ≈øeruitude of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. And let vs con≈øider the≈øe thinges ≈øo, that we who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may bende our ≈øelues to put away all the oldenes of our fle≈øh, whence in dede corruption and death doth come, and that we may prouoke our ≈øelues to the newnes of the ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite and the lyfe of Chri≈øte, wherin is all incorruption and the true ta≈øte of the re≈øurrection: for to thys ende the holy gho≈øt dyd wryte this by the Apo≈øtle.

followeth that though we be ab≈øent in body, yet are we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent in ≈øpirite, coupled together wyth the vnitie of fayth in the bond of peace, which is loue. How is be worthy y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of a frend, that mea≈øureth hys friend≈øhip wyth the di≈øtance of place, or partyng of per≈øons? If thy frende be out of ≈øight, is thy frend≈øhip ended? If he be gone into the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>trey, wilt thou cea≈øe to loue hym? If he be pa≈ø≈øed the ≈øeas, wilt thou ≈øo for≈øake him? If he be caried into heauen, is charity hyndred therby? On the one ≈øyde, we haue the v≈øe of the fathers from the primatiue church, that gaue tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>kes for their frends that died in the fayth, to proue that charity died not wyth death. On the other ≈øide (≈øaith Horace) <hi>Coelum non animum mutant qui trans mare currunt.</hi> What ≈øpeake I of Horace? Saith not S. Paule the ≈øame thyng? For we are me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>bers of hys body, of hys fle≈øhe, and of hys blood: yea we are members one of another. Is the hande, or arme, foote, or legge, a member when it is di≈ø≈øeuered from the body? How can we be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers except we be ioyned together? What is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> line that cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleth vs but loue? When all thinges ≈øhall fayle, loue fayleth neuer. Hope hath his ende, when we get that we hoped for. Fayth is fyny≈øhed in heauen. Loue endureth for euer: loue I ≈øay that procedeth of charity. For carnall loue (when that which he loued is lo≈øt) doth pery≈øhe wyth the fle≈øh. Neither was that euer but fle≈øhly loue, which by di≈øtaunce of place, or ≈øeueryng of bodies, is parted a ≈øunder. If loue be the end, or ≈øu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>me of the lawe: yf heauen and earth ≈øhal peri≈øhe: if one iote of gods word ≈øhall not decay, why ≈øhould we thynke that loue la≈øteth not euer?

But thys I ≈øay, if we kept Chri≈øtes commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in louyng eche other, as he loued vs, then ≈øhould our loue be euerla≈øtyng. Thys frend≈øhyp Paule felt when it mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued hym to ≈øay, that neyther length nor bredth (meaning no di≈øtance of place) neither height nor depth ≈øhould ≈øeuer him from the loue of Chri≈øte.

in your ≈øight I am. Your reque≈øt I will trulye performe to the vttermo≈øte of my power, as gladly as any poore wretch ≈øhall doe in the worlde, and I thanke GOD I haue done no le≈ø≈øe of longe tyme. And as my poore prayer ≈øhall be a hand mayde to wayte vppon you whiche waye ≈øo euer you tyde or goe, ≈øo I be≈øeche you that my ≈øimple coun≈øell maye take ≈øome place in you, in thys time of your pilgrimage, whiche you pa≈ø≈øe in no ≈ømall parell: GOD keepe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerue you for his names ≈øake. I doe not di≈øalowe, but muche pray≈øe and commende your hartye boldene≈ø≈øe in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng your ≈øelfe in prea≈ø≈øe, when any one of Gods people needeth your helpe in anye poynte. But yet I woulde not haue you thru≈øte your ≈øelfe in daunger, when you can doe them no good, or at lea≈øt wy≈øe when they maye well enoughe ≈øpare that good you woulde doe them. For if you ≈øhoulde then chaunce to bee taken, you ≈øhall not onelye bee no comforte vnto them, but al≈øo a greate di≈øcomforte, adding ≈øorrowe vnto their ≈øorrowe. I doe not per≈øuade you to ab≈øente your ≈øelfe from anye place where your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence of nece≈ø≈øity is requyred, for in all ≈øuch places, I know, GOD will pre≈øerue you, as he hath hetherto wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye done, pray≈øed be his name therefore: or if it ≈øhal plea≈øe him to permitte you in any ≈øuch place to bee taken, I know he will mo≈øte ≈øweetelye comforte your con≈øcience with this con≈øideration, that it is the verye prouidence and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente of GOD that you ≈øhoulde there and then bee taken vppe for a witne≈ø≈øe of hys truth vnto the worlde: but I can not allowe you, nor bee contented that you ≈øhoulde ra≈øhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye or negligentlye thru≈øte your ≈øelfe into that place where your wicked enemies doe continually haunte, yea and laye waite for you, when no nece≈ø≈øitie of your ≈øelfe nor of anye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Gods people doth require your companye.

And for a≈ømuche as we haue a better life to come then this pre≈øent is, an eternall ≈øocietie w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chri≈øt, whiche neyther the malice of tyme, neither the di≈øtance of place can di≈ø≈øolue or ≈øeparate: I exhort you now as one y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath obtained mercy of god in the reparacion of hys image in me, to embrace the care therof, with earne≈øt de≈øyre to attayn y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ≈øame, wherby we ≈øhal al haue a perfect fruition of our loue &amp; frend≈øhip, which alreadye we haue here begon, &amp; with god in heauen ≈øhalbee (wythout all doute) made ioyfully perfect.</p>
            <p>Let this be a perpetual remembrance of your poore afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted frend, which daily loketh through fire, to enter into that eternal life, where he tru≈øteth a≈ø≈øuredly to enioy your fellow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>≈øhip, if the image of god be renued in you through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chri≈øt, which you haue receyued &amp; do know. Loke who≈øe image the coyne beareth, his it is. Semblably, if your conuer≈øation be after the go≈øpell, verely you are the elect of Chri≈øt: but if it be according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, his ≈øeruants you are whom your lyfe doth expre≈ø≈øe. We haue all in Bapti≈øme put on Chri≈øt, whom if we endeuour to repre≈øe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t, we are in dede the ≈øonnes of God and inheritours wyth Chri≈øt. One good rule S. Paule to the Rom. in the xij. chap. doth appoint for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> re≈øtauration of this our image of God. Fa≈øhion not your ≈øelues (≈øaith he) vnto thys world, but be ye chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ged in your ≈øhape, by the renewyng of your mynde, that ye maye proue what is the will of god, which thing is good, acceptable &amp; perfect. God grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t that this rule may take place with you, &amp; then doutles our companye ≈øhall be in≈øeparable wyth all the ≈øaynts of God in eternall ble≈ø≈øe.</p>
            <p>Be you not deceyued by the vayne po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions and vncer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayne plea≈øures of this worlde, whiche ≈øerue to none other

purpo≈øe, then to blynde your eyes that they mighte not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the things which be glorious and permanent for euer. The thynges whiche we ≈øee, are mortall: but the thynges which we ≈øee not but certainly hope for, be immortall. For all fle≈øh, as the Prophete E≈øay ≈øaythe, is but gra≈ø≈øe, and the glory therof as the flower of the fielde. Oh that you whiche haue the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions of thys world, would ≈øo accompt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, &amp; not ≈øel your eternal inheritance for a me≈ø≈øe of porrige, as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øau dyd. God open your eyes that you may ≈øee the glory of Chri≈øt in the mount wyth Peter, Iohn, and Iames. Then I doubte not, you would ≈øay with Peter. Lord it is good for vs to abyde here: let vs here make our dwelling places. We haue in this world no fyrme man≈øion, but we ≈øeke after that which is to come: the which yf we ≈øeke nowe where it maye be found, we ≈øhal ≈øurely finde it. If we mortify the image of Adam, which through ≈øynne raigneth in our fle≈øh, then ≈øhal the image of Chri≈øt reuiue in vs to our eternall glorye. We are all bapti≈øed to die wyth Chri≈øte, to the ende we ≈øhoulde walke in newnes of lyfe as per≈øons dead to the world, and liuyng to God.

God illighten our eyes that we may vnder≈øtand how precious an inheritaunce Chri≈øt hath prepared for ≈øuche as hunger and thur≈øt therafter. Then I doubte not we would ≈øay wyth Sayncte Paule, I am ≈øure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly per≈øuaded that neyther deathe nor lyfe, neyther Aungels nor rule, neyther power, neyther thynges pre≈øent, neyther thynges to come, neyther anye other trea≈øure, or creature, ≈øhall ≈øeparate vs from the loue whych is in Chri≈øte Ie≈øus.

            <p>This is the Summe of all our chri≈øtian religion which we doe profe≈ø≈øe: which yf we followe, happy are we that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer we were borne.

You report me to my face that I am a great ≈ølaunder to the church of God: which maye be two wayes vnder≈øtand, that is by lyuyng &amp; doctryne. But as for liuing you your ≈øelues (I thanke god therfore) gaue te≈øtimonye with me. In doctrine therefore you meane it. Now, in that there be many partes of the doctrine of chri≈øt, I trow you meane not generally, but perticulerly: for you in generalitie haue diuers tymes geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> your commendation on my behalfe, both to my face and behynd my backe: for the which I hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>bly pray≈øe my god, through Chri≈øt.

For if per≈øeueraunce be not a cau≈øe, but onely gods grace in Chri≈øt the whole and only cau≈øe of ≈øaluation: then the cau≈øe, that is to ≈øay grace remaining, the thing, that is to ≈øay ≈øaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, cannot but remayne al≈øo. Of which thing, if wyth the ≈øcriptures you woulde make per≈øeueraunce an effect or fruite, then could you not be offended at the truth: but ≈øay as it ≈øaithe, that the ≈øaluation of gods chyldren is ≈øo certayne, that they ≈øhall neuer finally peri≈øhe, the lorde put<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting his hand vnder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, that if they fal, yet they ≈øhal not lie ≈øtil.

               </note> neither ≈øhold they go out of gods church, but as Paule ≈øayth, ≈øhoulde per≈øeuer to the ende.
