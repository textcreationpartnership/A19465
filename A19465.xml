            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trari to the crown and lawes of Englande.</note> I was ſworn neuer to conſent, that the byſhop of Rome ſhoulde haue or exerciſe any autoritie or iuriſdiction in this realme of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, therfore leaſt I ſhould allowe his authority contrary to myne othe, I refuſed to make aunſwer to the byſhop of Glouceſter ſytting here in iudgement by the Popes autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, leaſte I ſhould runne into periury.</p>
               <p>An other cauſe why I refuſed the Popes auctority is this, that hys auctority as he claymeth it, repugneth to the crowne imperial of this realme &amp; to the lawes of the ſame, whych euery true ſubiect is bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.

But contrary to thys clayme, the emperial crowne &amp; iuriſdiction temporall of thys realme, is taken immediatly from God to be vſed vnder hym only, and is ſubiecte vnto

alſo the lawes of God,<note place="margin">The popes religion is agaynſt Chriſts re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligion.</note> ſo that whoſoeuer be vnder hys au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, he ſuffereth them not to be vnder Chriſtes religion purely, as Chriſt did commaunde. And for one example I brought forth, that wheras by Gods lawes al chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be bounde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diligently to learne hys word, that they may know how to beleue and liue accordingly, for that purpoſe he ordayned holy daies when they ought, leauyng apart all other buſines,<note place="margin">Why latin ſeruice oughte not to be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Eng<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lande.</note> to geue themſelues wholy to knowe &amp; ſerue God. Therfore Gods wyll and commaundement is, that when the people be gathered together, the miniſters ſhuld vſe ſuch language as the people maye vnderſtand, and take profite therby, or els hold theyr peace. For as an harpe or lute, if it geue no certaine ſound that men may know what is ſtriken, who can daunce after it, for all the ſounde is in vayne? ſo is it vayne and profiteth nothyng, ſayeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty god, by the mouth of S. Paule, if the prieſt ſpeake to the people in a language which they knowe not, for els he may profite hymſelfe, but profiteth not the people ſayeth S. Paule. But herein I was anſwered thus, that S. Paul ſpake only of preachyng, that the preacher ſhould ſpeake in a tongue which the people did know, or els hys preachyng auayleth nothing. But yf the preachyng auayleth nothing, being ſpoken in a language, which the people vnderſtande not, how ſhould any other ſeruice auayle them, beyng ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the ſame language? And that yet S. Paule ment not only of preachyng, it appeareth plainly by his own words, for he ſpeaketh by name expreſſely of praying, ſingyng, lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng, and thankyng of God and of al other thynges which the Prieſtes ſay in the churches, wherunto the people ſaye <hi>Amen,</hi> which they vſed not in preaching, but in other diuine ſeruice: that whether the Prieſtes rehearſe the wonderfull workes of god, or the great benefites of god vnto mankind aboue all other creatures, or geue tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks vnto god, or make open profeſſion of theyr faith, or humble confeſſion of theyr ſynnes, wyth earneſt requeſte of mercy and forgeuenes, or make ſute or requeſt vnto god for any thyng: then al the people vnderſtandyng what the Prieſtes ſay, myght ioyne theyr myndes and voyces wyth them and ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> that is to ſaye, allowe what the Prieſtes ſaye, that the reherſall of Gods vniuerſall workes and benefites, the geuyng of thankes, the profeſſion of faith, the confeſſion of ſynnes, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:9364:9"/>
the requeſtes and petitions of the Prieſtes and the people, might aſcend vp into the eares of god altogether, and be as a ſwete ſauour, odour, and incenſe in hys noſe: &amp; thus was it vſed many hundred yerrs after Chriſtes aſcenſion. But the aforeſayde thynges cannot be done, when the prieſtes ſpeake to the people in a language not knowen, and ſo they or theyr clarke in theyr name ſay, Amen, but they cannot tell wherunto: where as ſaint Paule ſaith, how can the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple ſay Amen to thy well ſaying, when they vnderſtand not what thou ſaieſt? And thus was S. Paule vnderſtanded of all interpretours, both the Grekes and Latines, olde and new, ſcholeautors and others, that I haue redde, vntyll a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout xxx. yeres paſt, at which time one Eckius with other of hys ſort began to deuyſe a new expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vnderſtanding S.

But when a good number of the beſt learned men reputed wythin thys realme, ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouryng the old ſome the new learnyng, as they terme it (where in dede that which they call the old, is the newe and that which they call the new, is in dede the old) but when a great number of ſuch learned men of both ſortes were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together at wynſor for the reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſeruice of the Churche: It was agreed by bothe wythout contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie, (not one ſayeng contrary) that the Seruyce of the Church ought to be in the mother tongue and that Sainct Paule in the <hi>.14.</hi> chapter to the Corynthians was ſo to bee vnderſtanded. And ſo is ſainct Paule to be vnderſtanded in the ciuil law more then a thouſand yeres paſt, where <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinianus</hi> amoſte godly Emperour, in a ſynode writeth on thys maner. <hi>Iubemus vt omnes epiſcopi pariter &amp; praeſbyterî non tacito modo, ſed clara voce quae a fideli populo exaudia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tur, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cram oblationem &amp; preces in ſacro baptiſmate adhibitas celebre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, quo maiori exinde deuotione in depromendis Domini Dei laudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus audientium animi efferantur.

And againe I ſaid, wheras our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt ordained the Sacrament of his moſt precious body and bloud, to be receaued of all chriſtian people vnder the formes both of breade and wine, and ſaide of the cuppe, drinke ye all of this: the Pope geueth a cleane contrarye commaundemente, that no laye man ſhall drynke of the cup of their ſaluation: as thoughe the cuppe of Saluation by the bloud of Chriſt, pertained not to lay men. And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Theophilus Alexandrinus,</hi> (whoſe workes Saincte Hierom did tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlate about eleauen hundred yeres paſſed) ſaith that if Chriſt had bene crucified for the Deuils, his cup ſhoulde not be denied them: yet the Pope denieth the cup of Chriſt to chriſten people, for whome Chriſt was crucified: ſo that if I ſhould obey the Pope, in theſe thinges I muſte nedes diſobey my ſauior Chriſt. But I was anſwered hereto (as commonly the papiſts do anſwer,) that vnder the forme of bread, is whole chriſtes fleſh and bloude, ſo that whoſoeuer receaueth the forme, of bread receiueth aſwel chriſtes bloud as his fleſhe. Let it be ſo: yet in the forme of breade onely, Chriſtes bloude is not dronken but eaten, nor receaued in the cuppe vnder forme of wyne as Chriſt commaunded, but eaten with the fleſh vnder the forme of breade, &amp; moreouer
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:9364:10"/>
the bread is not the ſacrament of his bloud, but of his fleſhe only, nor the cup is not the ſacrament of his fleſh, but of his bloud only and ſo the Pope kepeth from al lay perſons the Sacrament of their redemption by Chriſtes bloud, which Chriſt commaunded to geue vnto them. And furthermore Chriſt ordayned the ſacrament in two kindes, the one ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the other, to be a repreſentation of his deathe, where his bloud was ſeparated from hys fleſhe, whiche is not repreſented in one kynde alone: ſo that the lay people receiue not the whole ſacrament, wherby Chriſtes death is repreſented as he commaunded. Moreouer as the Pope ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vpon him to geue the temporal ſword or royal &amp; impe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rial power to kinges &amp; prynces: ſo doth he likewiſe take v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him to depoſe them from theyr imperial ſtates, if they be diſobedient to hym, and commaundeth the ſubiectes to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey their prynces, aſſoyling the ſubiectes aſwel of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, as of their lawfull othes made vnto theyr true kinges and Prynces directly contrary to gods commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniente, who commaundeth all ſubiectes to obey theyr kinges or other rulers vnder them. One Iohn Patriarche of Conſtantinople in the time of S.

But ſayeth Saincte Gregorye, if anye one ſhall exalte him ſelfe aboue all the reſt to be the vniuerſal biſhoppe, the ſame paſſeth in pryde: but now the biſhop of Rome exalteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe not only aboue all biſhops, but alſo aboue all kynges and Emperours, and aboue the whole world taking vpon hym to geue and take away, to ſet vp and put downe, as he ſhall thinke good.

liberties, lawes, and cuſtomes of thys realme, but moſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to diſcharge my conſcience in vtteryng the truthe to gods glory, caſtyng away all feare,<note place="margin">Luke. 12</note> by the comfort which I haue in Chriſtes wordes, who ſayeth: <hi>Feare not them that kill the body and cannot kill the Soule, but feare hym that can caſte both body and ſoule into hell.</hi> He that for feare to loſe this life will forſake the truth, ſhall loſe the euerlaſting lyfe: and he that for the truthes ſake wyll ſpend hys lyfe, ſhall fynde e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting life.

               <p>As touchyng the Sacrament, I ſaide that foraſmuch as the whole matter ſtandeth in the vnderſtandyng of theſe wordes of Chriſt: <hi>Thys is my body, Thys is my bloud,</hi> I ſaye that Chriſt in theſe wordes made demonſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the bread and wyne, and ſpake figuratiuely,<note place="margin">The ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments haue the names of thoſe thyngs wherof they are ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.</note> callyng bread hys bodye and wyne hys bloud, bicauſe he ordeyned them to be the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of his body &amp; bloud. And where the Papiſts ſay in theſe two pointes contrary vnto me, that Chriſt called not bread hys body, but a ſubſtaunce vncertayne, nor ſpake fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiuely, herein I ſayde I woulde be iudged by the olde church, and which doctrine could be proued the elder, that I would ſtand vnto. And foraſmuch as I haue alleaged in my booke many olde autors both Grekes and Latynes, which about a thouſand yeres after Chriſt continually taught as I do, if they could bryng forth but one old author that ſaith in theſe two poyntes as they ſay, I offred vi. or vij. yeres agoe, and doe offer yet ſtyl, that I will geue place to them. But when I bryng for the any author that ſayeth in moſte playne termes as I do, yet ſayeth the other parte, that the authors mente not ſo: as who ſhoulde ſay, that the authors ſpake one thyng and mente cleane contrarye. And vppon the other parte, when they cannot fynde any one authour that ſayeth in wordes as they ſay, yet ſaye they that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as they ſay. Now whether thei or I ſpeake more to the purpoſe herein, I refer it to the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of all indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent hearers. Yea the old church of Rome aboute a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:9364:12"/>
yeres together, nether beleued nor vſed the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as the church of Rome hath done of late yeares. For in the beginning the church of Rome taught a pure &amp; a ſound doc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trine of the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but after that the church of Rome fell into a new doctrine of tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſubſtantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; with the doctrine they chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged the vſe of the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, &amp; the old church of Rome vſed aboue a M. yeares. And yet to deface the old thei ſay that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> new is the old: wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in for my part I am co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to the tryal to ſtand, But their doctrine is ſo fonde and vncomfortable, that I marueile that any man would allowe it, if he knewe what it is, and what ſo euer they beare the people in hand,<note place="margin">The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts make Chriſt two bodyes.</note> that which they write in theyr bookes hath nother truth nor comforte. For by their doctrin, of one body of Chriſt is made two bodies: one naturall hauing diſtance of members with forme and proporcion of a mannes perfite body, and thys bodye is in Heauen, but the bodye of Chriſte in the Sacramente by theyr own doctrine, muſt nedes be a monſtruous body, hauing neyther diſtance of members nor forme, faſhion or proporcion of a mans naturall body, and ſuch a body is in the ſacrament (teache they) and goeth into the mouth with the forme of breade, and entreth no farther than the forme of bread goeth, nor tarieth no lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the forme of bread is by natural heate in digeſting, ſo that when the forme of breade is digeſted, that bodye of Chriſte is gone. And foraſmuch as euil men be as long in digeſting as good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the body of Chriſt (by theyr doctrine) entreth as far, &amp; tari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as long in wicked as in godly me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forte ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be herein to any Chriſtian ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to receaue Chriſts vnſhape<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> body, and it to entre no father than the ſtomake, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part by and by, as ſone as the bread is conſumed? It ſemeth to me a more ſound and comfortable doctrine, that Chriſte hath but one body, &amp; that hath forme and faſhion of a mans true body, which body ſpiritually entreth into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> body and ſoule, and though the ſacrament be conſumed, yet whole Chriſte remayneth and fedeth the receauer vnto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal lyfe, if he continue in godlines and neuer departe, vntill the receauer forſake him. And as for the wicked, they haue not Chriſt within the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at al, who ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be wher Belial is. And this is my faith, and as me ſemeth a ſound doctrine
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:9364:12"/>
according to Gods word, and ſufficient for a Chriſtian to be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leue in that matter. And if it canne be ſhewed vnto me, that the popes authority is not preiudicial to the thinges before mencioned, or that my doctryne in the ſacrament is erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous (whych I thinke can not be ſhewed) then I was neuer nor wilbe ſo peruerſe, to ſtand wilfully in mine owne opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but I ſhall (wyth al humility) ſubmit my ſelf vnto the Pope not only to kiſſe hys feete, but an other part alſo.</p>
               <p>An other cauſe why I refuſed to take the B. of Glouceſtre for my iudge, was the reſpect of his own perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being more than once periured Fyrſte, for that he beynge diuerſe times ſworne, neuer to conſent that the B. of Rome ſhoulde haue any iuriſdiction with in thys realme, but to take the king and his ſucceſſours for ſupreame heades of thys realme, as by gods lawes they be: contrary to this lawful oth the ſaid B. ſate then in iudgement by autority fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rome, wherin he was periured, and not worthy to ſit as a iudge.</p>
               <p>The ſecond periury was, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he toke his biſhoprike both of the Queenes Maieſtye &amp; of the Pope, makyng to eche of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ſolemne oth, which othes be ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, that in the one he muſt nedes be periured. And furthermore in ſwering to the Pope to mayntayne his lawes, decrees, a conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ordinances reſeruations, and prouiſions, he declareth him ſelfe an enemye to the Imperial crowne and to the Lawes and ſtate of this Realme, whereby he declared himſelfe not worthy to ſyt as a iudge within this Realme, and for theſe conſiderations I refuſed to take him for my Iudge.</p>

concernyng my ſelfe I can report, that I neuer knew nor heard of a more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſed diſputation in al my life.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He law of nature requyreth of al men, that ſo farforth as it may be done without offence to god, euery one ſhould ſeke to defend and pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſerue hys owne life. Whiche thyng, when I about three dayes ago bethought my ſelfe of, and therewithall remembred how that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyn Luther appealed in hys time from Pope Leo the tenth to a generall counſell (leaſt I ſhoulde ſeeme raſhlye and vnaduiſedly to caſt away my ſelf) I determined to appeale in lyke ſort to ſome lawful and free general counſel. But ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng the order and forme of an appeale perteyneth to the lawyers, wherof I my ſelf am ignorant, and ſeing that Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers appeale co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth not to my hand: I purpoſed to break my mind in this matter to ſome faithful fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d &amp; ſkilful in the law, whoſe helpe I myght vſe in thys behalf, and you only among other came to my remembraunce as a man moſte meete in this vniuerſitye for that purpoſe. But this is a matter that requyreth great ſilence, ſo that no man knowe of it before it bee done. It is ſo that I am ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moned to make myne aunſwer at Rome, the .xvi. day of this moneth, before the which daye I thynke it good after ſentence pronounced to make mine appeale. But whether I ſhould fyrſt appeale from the iudge delegate to the Pope, and ſo afterwarde to the generall counſell, or elles leauyng the Pope, I ſhoulde appeale immediatly to the counſell: herein I ſtand in neede of your counſell. Many cauſes there bee for the whiche I thinke good to appeale. Firſt becauſe I am by an oth bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de neuer to conſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the receiuing of the biſhop of Romes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority into this realme. Beſides this, where as I vtterly re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fuſed to make aunſwere to the articles obiected vnto me by the biſhop of Glouceſter appointed by the Pope to bee my iudge, yet I was content to aunſwer Martyn and Story, with this proteſtation, that mine anſwer ſhould not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as made before a iudge, nor yet in place of iudgement, but as pertayning nothing to iudgement at al: and moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer after I had made mine aunſwere I required to haue a copy of the ſame, that I might, either by addyng therunto, by alteryng or takyng from it, correcte and amend it, as I thought good. The which though both the biſhop of Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter and alſo the kyng and Quenes proctors promiſed me
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:9364:16"/>
yet haue they altogether broken promiſe with me, and haue not permitted me to correct my ſayde aunſweres ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordinge to my requeſt, and yet notwithſtandyng haue (as I vnderſtande) regeſtred the ſame as actes formally done in place of iudgemente. Finallye foraſmuch as all thys my trouble commeth vpon my departinge from the byſhop of Rome and from the popiſhe religion, ſo that nowe the quarel is betwixte the Pope himſelfe and me, and no man can be a lawfull and indifferente iudge in his owne cauſe: it ſeemeth (me thinke) good reaſon that I ſhould be ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to appeale to ſome generall counſell in thys matter: ſpeciallye ſeinge the lawe of nature (as they ſaye) denyeth no man, the remedye of appeale in ſuch caſes. Now, ſince it is very requiſite that this matter ſhoulde be kepte as cloſe as maye<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be, if perhappes for lack of perfect ſkill herein you ſhall haue nede of further aduiſe: then I beſeche you euen for the fidelity and loue you beare to me in Chriſt, that you wyl open to no creature aliue whoſe the caſe is. And foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the time is now at hand, and the matter requireth great expeditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, let me obteine thys much of you, I beſeche you, that layng a ſide all other your ſtudies and buſines for the time, you wyll applye thys my matter onlye tyll you haue broughte it to paſſe. The chiefeſte cauſe in very deede (to tell you the truth) of thys myne appeale is, that I myghte gayne time (if it ſhall ſo pleaſe God) to lyue vntill I haue finiſhed myne aunſwere againſte Marcus Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Conſtantius which I haue now in hand.<note place="margin">This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius was Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in dede as a wether cock, who thus named him ſelfe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thys good father</note> But if the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaryes of the truthe wil not admyt myne appeale (as I feare they will not) Gods wyl be done: I paſſe not vpon it ſo that God may therein be glorified, be it by my life or by my death. For it is muche better for me to dye in Chriſtes quarell &amp; to raigne wyth hym, then here to be ſhutte vp &amp; kept in the pryſon of thys body, vnleſſe it were to continue yet ſtil a whyle in this warrefare for the commodity and profite of my Brethren and to the further aduauncyng of Gods glorye, to whome be all glorye for euermore, Amen. There is alſo yet an other cauſe whye I thynke good to appeale, that where as I am cited to goe to Rome to aun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſwere there for my ſelfe, I am notwythſtandyng kepte her faſte in priſon that I cannot there appeare at the tyme ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted. And moreouerforaſmuch as the ſtate I ſtande in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:9364:16"/>
is a matter of lyfe and death, ſo that I haue greate neede of learned counſel for my defence in thys behalfe: yet when I made my earneſt requeſt for the ſame, all manner of cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Item the letter <hi>Ad fratres in diuerſis carceribus.</hi> All theſe thinges they haue gotten of Grymbold (as my bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther doth ſuppoſe) not that Grymbold hath bewrayed hym but (as is ſuppoſed) one whiche my brother truſted to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye his letters vnto Grymbolde: for it will not ſynke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my heade to thinke that Grymbold woulde euer playe me ſuch a Iudas part. Although theſe things are chaunced farre otherwiſe then I had thoughte they ſhoulde (for my mynd was that they ſhoulde not haue comme abrode vntil my body had bene layd to reſte in peace) yet truely I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this is not thus chaunced without gods graciouſe pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uidence which he hath ouer al his, and I truſt that god of his goodnes ſhal turne it to hys owne glory. For it ſhal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently appeare to the reader of theſe thinges whych they haue, that the cauſe why I do diſſent from the Romiſh reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is not any ſtudy of vayne glory or of ſingularitye, but of conſcience, of my bound duty towardes god &amp; towardes Chriſtes church and the ſaluation of myne owne ſoule, for the which by gods grace I wyll wyllingly ieoperd here to loſe life lands and goods, name and fame, and what els is or ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be vnto me pleaſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in this world. My brother as yet, becauſe they nether ſhewed any comiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or authority wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bye they did examine him nor alſo anye thynge of his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (although they ſaid they had them) as yet I ſay my bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther hath confeſſed nothing. But I loke for none other but he ſhalbe forced to tel wher he hadde the copies and where they be, and I wylbe content that he ſhal ſay the truth, that he had them all of me, let them come and take them &amp; caſte them into the fire, if god know they wil promote his glory: they can do no more then he wil ſuffer them. Bicauſe in the booke of N. R. and H. L. it is ſaide in the ende that. H L. hath cauſed his ſeruant to write it, I would Auſtine ſhould haue word yf any farther ſearch be, to kepe hym out of the way. God ſhall rewarde you both for my brother: You my Lord of Caunt. for your meate and dayly comfort, and you father L. for your mony and comfortable meſſeges. I truſt in God my brother though he be younge yet wyl ſtudye to, learne to beare Chriſtes croſſe patienly as a yong Scholer in Chriſts Schole: God encreaſe his grace in vs all. Amen.</p>

How ioyful it was to vs to heare the reporte of D. Taylor &amp; of his godly confeſſion &amp;c: I enſure you, it is hard for me to expreſſe. Bleſſed be God which was and is the geuer of that and all godly ſtrength and ſtomacke in the time of aduerſity. As for the rumors that haue or doe go abroade either of our relenting or maſſing, we truſt that they which know god and theyr dutye towardes theyr bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in Chriſt, wil not be to lyght of credit to beleue them.

It ſhould do vs much comfort if we might haue knowledge of the ſtate of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt of our moſt dearely beloued, which in this troubleſome time doe ſtande in Chriſtes cauſe, and in the defence of the truth therof. We are in good health thankes be to God, &amp; yet the manner of our entreting doth chaung as ſoure ale doth in ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer. It is reported to vs of our kepers, that the vniuerſity beareth vs heauely. A cole chaunced to fal in the night out of the chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney &amp; burnt a hole in the floore, &amp; no more harme was done, the balifes ſeruants ſitting by the fyer.

A wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing, among ſo many, neuer yet ſcholer offred to any of vs (ſo farre as I know) any manner of fauor either for or in Chriſtes cauſe. Now as concerning your demaunde of our counſell, for my part I do not miſlike that which I perceiue ye are minded to do: for I loke for none other, but if ye aun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſwere before the ſame commiſſioners that we did, ye ſhalbe ſerued &amp; handled as we were, though ye were as wel lerned as euer was either Peter or Paule.

The Lorde which is the ſearcher of ſecrets, knoweth that accordyng to my hartes deſire, my hope was of late that I ſhould haue come among you, and to haue brought wyth me aboundaunce of Chriſtes bleſſed Goſpell, accordyng to the duetye of that office and miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, wherevnto among you I was choſen, named and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poincted by the mouth of that our late piereles Prince king Edwarde, and ſo alſo denounced openly in hys court by his priuye counſayle.</p>
               <p>I warne you all my welbeloued kynſfolke and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen, that ye be not amaſed or aſtonied at the kynde of my departure or diſſolution, for I enſure you I thynke it the moſt honour that euer I was called vnto in all my life, and therfore I thanke my Lorde GOD hartely for it, that it hath pleaſed hym to cal me of hys great mercye vnto this hyghe honour to ſuffer deathe wyllynglye for hys ſake, and in hys cauſe: vnto the which honour he called the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phets, &amp; hys dearly beloued Apoſtels, and hys bleſſed choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> martyrs. For knowe ye that I doubte no more, but that the cauſes wherefore I am put to deathe, are gods cauſes and the cauſes of the truthe, then I doubte that the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell whyche Iohn wrote is the Goſpell of Chriſte, or that Paules Epyſtles are the verye worde of GOD.

Thys Churche of Englande had of late of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite goodneſſe and aboundaunte grace of almighty God, greate ſubſtaunce, greate ryches of heauenlye treaſure, greate plentye of gods true and ſyncere woorde, the true and wholeſome adminiſtration of Chriſtes holye Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, the whole profeſſion of Chriſtes religion truelye and playnelye ſette forthe in Baptiſme, the playne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration and vnderſtandyng of the ſame taughte in the holye Cathechiſme to haue beene learned of all true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:9364:47"/>
Chriſtes commaundements were executed and done. For vpon the bread and wyne ſet vpon the Lords table, thanks were geuen, the commemoration of the Lordes death was had, the bread in the remembraunce of chriſtes bodye torne vpon the croſſe, was broken, and the Cuppe in the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce of Chriſtes bloud ſhedde, was diſtributed, and both communicated vnto all that were preſente and woulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue them, and alſo they were exhorted of the miniſter ſo to doe.

               <p>Nowe for the commen publique prayers whiche were in the vulgare tongue, theſe theues haue brought in agayne

a ſtraunge tongue, whereof the people vnderſtande not one word. Wherein what doe they elles but robbe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of theyr diuyne Seruice, wherein they oughte to praye together wyth the mynyſter, and to praye in a ſtraunge toungue, what is it but (as Saincte Paule calleth it) barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſnes, chyldiſhenes, vnprofitable follye, yea and plaine madneſſe? For the godly articles of vnity in Religion, and for the wholſome Homelies, what doe theſe theeues place in the ſtead of them, but the Popes lawes and decrees, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Legendes and fayned fables and myracles, to delude and abuſe the ſymplycitye of the rude people. Thus thys robbery and thefte is not onelye committed, nay ſacrilege and wycked ſpoyle of heauenlye thynges, but alſo in the ſtead of the ſame, is brought in and placed the abbominable deſolacion of the tyraunte Antiochus, of proude Senache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryb, of the ſhameles faced kyng, &amp; of the Babilonical beaſte. Vnto thys robberye, thys thefte and ſacrilege, for that I cannot conſente nor (God wyllyng) neuer ſhall ſo long as the breath is in my bodye, becauſe it is blaſphemye againſte God, hyghe treaſon vnto Chriſte our heauenly Kyng, lord, maiſter, and oure onely Sauiour and redemer, it is playne contrarye to Gods worde and to Chriſtes Goſpell, it is the ſubuerſion of all true godlines, and agaynſte the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtyng ſaluation of myne owne ſoule, and of all my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and ſyſters whome Chryſte my Sauioure hathe ſo dearely boughte wyth no leſſe pryce then wyth the effuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſheddyng forthe of hys moſte precious bloude: therefore (all ye my true louers in GOD, my kynſefolke and countreymen) for thys cauſe (I ſay) know ye that I am put to deathe, whiche by Gods grace I ſhall wyllynglye take, wyth hartye thankes to GOD therefore, in certayne hope wythout any doubtyng, to receyue at gods hande a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne of his free mercy and grace, euerlaſtyng life.</p>
               <p>Althoughe the cauſe of the true man ſlayne of the thefe helpyng hys neyghboure to recouer hys goodes agayne, and the cauſe wherefore I am to bee put to deathe, in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralitye is bothe one (as I ſayde before) yet knowe ye that there is no ſmall difference. Theſe theeues againſt whome I doe ſtande, are muche worſe then the robbers

Theſe theeues are worſe (I ſay) for they are more cruelll, more wycked, more falſe, more deceytfull and craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye: for thoſe will but kyll the bodye, but theſe wyll not ſtycke to kyll bothe bodye and ſoule. Thoſe for the generall thefte and robberye, be called and are in deede theues and robbers: but theſe for theyr ſpirituall kynd of robberye are called <hi>Sacrilegi,</hi> as ye woulde ſay, churche robbers. They are more wycked: for thoſe goe aboute but to ſpoyle men of worldlye thynges, worldlye ryches, gold and ſyluer, and worldlye ſubſtaunce: theſe goe aboute in the wayes of the Deuill their ghoſtlye father, to ſteale from the vniuerſall churche, and peritcularlye from euerye man, all heauenlye treaſure, true faythe, true charitye and hope of ſaluation in the bloude of oure Sauioure Ieſus Chriſte, yea to ſpoile vs of our Sauiour Chriſt, of hys goſpel, of hys heauenlye ſpirite, and of the heauenlye heritage of the kingdome of heauen ſo dearelye purchaſed vnto vs wyth the deathe of oure Maiſter and Sauyoure Chriſte. Theſe be the goodes and godlye ſubſtaunce whereuppon the Chriſtian before God muſt lyue, and withoute the whiche he cannot lyue: theſe goodes (I ſaye) theſe theues, theſe churche robbers, goe aboute to ſpoyle vs of. The whiche goodes, as to the man of God they excell and farre paſſe all worldlye trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: ſo to wythſtande euen vnto the death ſuche theues as goe aboute to ſpoyle both vs and the whole churche of ſuch goods, is moſt hyghe &amp; honourable ſeruice done vnto God. Theſe churche robbers be alſo much more falſe, craftye, and deceytfull then the theues vpon the borders: for theſe haue not the crafte ſo to commende theyr thefte that they dare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouche it, and therefore as acknowledgyng themſelues to be euyll, they ſteale commenlye vppon the nyghte, they dare not appeare at iudgements and ſeſſions where iuſtice is exe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cuted, &amp; when they are taken &amp; brought thether, they neuer hange any man, but they bee ofte tymes hanged for theyr faultes: But theſe Church robbers can ſo cloke and coloure theyr ſpiritual robbery, that they can make the people to be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leue falſhed to be truth, and truth falſhod, good to be euel, &amp;

But of thys I am aſſured, that the wycked world with all his force and power, ſhall not touche one of the heares of our heades wythout leaue ad lycence of oure heauenly father, whoſe wyll be done in al thynges. If he wyll lyfe, lyfe bee it: if he wyll deathe, deathe be it.

But nowe is the tyme of tryall, to ſee whether we feare more God or man. It was an eaſy thing to hold with Chriſt, whiles the prince and world held with hym: but now the worlde hateth hym, is the true tryall who be hys. Wherfore in the name and in the vertue, ſtrength, and power of his holy ſpiryte, prepare youre ſelues in any caſe to aduerſitye and conſtancie. Lette vs not runne away when it is moſt tyme to fyght. Remem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber that none ſhalbe crowned but ſuch as fyghte manfully, and he that endureth vnto the ende, ſhalbe ſaued. Ye muſte now turne all your cogitations from the peryll ye ſee, and marke by fayth what foloweth the peryl: either victorye in this worlde of your enemies, or els a ſurrender of this life, to inherite the euerlaſtyng kyngdome. Beware of behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to much the felicity or the myſerye of this worlde: for the conſideration and earneſt loue or feare of eyther of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, draweth from god. Wherfore thynke wyth youre ſelues as touchyng the felicity of the worlde, it is good, but yet none otherwyſe then it ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth with the fauoure of god: it is to be kept, but yet ſo farre forthe as by kepyng of it, we looſe not god. It is good to abyde and tary ſtyll among our frendes here, but yet ſo that we tary not therwithall in gods diſplea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſure, and hereafter to dwell in hell with the deuils in fyre e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſtyng. There is nothyng vnder god by may be kept, ſo that god beyng aboue all thynges we haue, be not loſte. Of aduerſity iudge the ſame. Impriſonment is paynefull: but yet liberty vpon euil conditions is more payneful. The priſons ſtincke, but yet not ſo much as ſwete houſes, where as the feare and true honor of god lacketh. I muſt be alone and ſolitary, it is better ſo to be and haue god with me, thou to be in company with the wicked. Loſſe of goods is great, but loſſe of gods grace and fauour is greater. I am a poore ſymple creature and cannot tell how to anſwer before ſuch a greate ſorte of noble, learned, and wyſe: It is better to

make anſwer before the pompe and pryde of wycked men, then to ſtande naked in the ſyght of all heauen and earth be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore the iuſte God, at the latter daye. I ſhal dye then by the handes of the cruell man: he is bleſſed that looſeth this life full of mortall miſeries and fyndeth the lyfe full of eternal ioyes. It is a griefe to depart from goods and frendes, but yet not ſo much as to depart from grace and heauen it ſelf. Wherefore there is neither felicitye nor aduerſitie of this world, that can appeare to be greate, if it be wayed with the ioyes or paynes in the worlde to come. I can doe no more but praye for you: doe the ſame for me for Gods ſake. For my parte I thanke the heauenly father, I haue made myne accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptes &amp; appointed my ſelfe vnto the wil of the heauen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly father: as he will, ſo I will by his grace. For gods ſake, as ſoone as ye can, ſende my poore wyfe and chyldren ſome letter from you, and my letter alſo whiche I ſente of late to Downton. As it is tolde me, ſhe had neuer letter from me, ſith the comming of maſter S vnto her: the more to blame the meſſengers, for I haue written diuers times.

Then by the meanes of a good gentlewoman, I had libertye to come downe to dinner and ſupper, and not to ſpeake wyth any of my frendes: but as ſoone as dinner and ſupper was done, to repayre to my chamber againe. Notwithſtanding, whiles I came downe thus to dinner and ſupper, the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and hys wyfe pyked quarels with me, and complained vntruly of me to their great frend, the biſhop of wincheſter.</p>
               <p>After one quarter of a yeare, and ſomewhat more, the Warden and hys wyfe fell out with me, for the wicked maſſe

and thereupon, the warden reſorted to the byſhop of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, &amp; obteined to put me into the wardes, where I haue continued a long time, hauing nothing appoynted to me for my bedde, but a little pad of ſtraw, a rotten couerynge, with a tike and a few fethers therin, the chamber beyng vile and ſtynckynge, vntill by Gods meanes, good people ſente me bedding to lye in: of the one ſide of which priſon, is the ſynke &amp; filth of all the houſe, &amp; on the other ſyde, the towne ditch: ſo that the ſtinche of the houſe hath infected me wythe ſundrye diſeaſes. During which tyme, I haue bene ſicke, &amp; the dores, barres, haſpes and chaynes beinge all cloſed, and made faſte vpon me, I haue mourned, called and cryed for helpe. But the warden, when he hath knowen me many tymes redy to dye, and when the poore men of the wardes haue called to helpe me, hath commaunded the doores to be kepte faſt, and charged that none of hys men ſhould come at me, ſayenge: lette hym alone, it were a good riddaunce of hym. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge manye other tymes, he did thus the 18. of October. 1553. as many can witnes. I payd alwayes like a Baron to the ſayd warden, aſwell in fees as for my boord, whych was xx. ſhyllinges a weke, beſides my mans table, vntil I was wrongfullye depriued of my biſhoprycke. And ſithens that time, I haue payde hym, as the beſte gentleman doth in hys houſe? yet hath he vſed me worſe and more vylye, then the verieſt ſlaue that euer came to the hall commons.

Weſton and hys complices haue opteined forth the commiſſion already, and ſpedely (moſt lyke) he wyl put it in execution. Wherfore deare brethren, I do aduertyſe you of the thing before for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe cauſes.

Wherfore I mynd neuer to aunſwere them, except I haue the bookes preſent, becauſe they vſe not only falſe allegation of the doctors, but alſo a pece of the D. againſt the whole courſe of the doctors mind. The next, that we may haue ſworne notaries to take thinges ſpoken, indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, which will be very hard to haue, for the aduerſaries wyll haue the ouerſyght of al thynges, and then make theirs better then it was, and ours worſe then it was. Then if we ſee that two or three or more will ſpeake together, or with ſcoffes and tauntes illude and mocke vs, I ſuppoſe it were beſte to appeale, to be heard before the Quene and the whole Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel, &amp; that would much ſetforth the glory of god. For ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny of them know already the truth, manye of them erre ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of zeale then malice, and the others that be iudurate ſhould be aunſweared fully to theyr ſhame (I doubt not) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though to our ſmarte and bloodſheedyng.

Wherfore my deare brethren in the mercye of Ieſus Chryſte, I would be gladde to know your aduyſe thys daye or to morrowe, for ſhortlye we ſhall be gone, and I verelye ſuppoſe that we ſhall not companye together, but be kepte abroade one from the other. They wyll denye oure appeale, yet let vs challenge the appeale, and take wytneſſe therof of ſuch as be preſent, and require for indiffencye of hearynge, and iudgemente to be hearde eyther before the Quene and the Counſell, or els before all the parleame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as they were vſed in kyng Edwards dayes. Further, for my parte I will requyre both bookes and tyme to aunſweare.

We dyd put our truſt in fleſhe, and where as Gods ſpirite in fleſhe dwelled, as in our holy &amp; bleſſed kyng Edward the ſixte, he is now dead in the fleſh, and his holy ſoule reſteth with the heauenly father in ioyes for euer: he is nowe (I ſaye) taken from vs and cannot helpe vs, &amp; ſuch as in his tyme, ſeemed much to fauour the glory of god, are become gods enemies, &amp; can both hear other to proced againſt the glory of god, &amp; alſo ſet fort y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues as much as thei may: ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch ſpirituall and godly perſons as ſought in the fleſh gods glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry are taken from vs, or els in ſuch caſe, as they can doe vs no good. And ſuch fleſhe as folowed and loued God in the ſighte of the worlde, and had great vauntage by hys word, are become his very enemies, and not only his, but alſo ene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mies to hys members. But yet as kyng Dauyd knew his foliſh foly, and with repentaunce repented and found grace: ſo it may pleaſe god to geue vs of his grace &amp; holy ſpirit, to amend our faultes in the lyke offence, and helpe vs, as he did him. But doubtles great is our iniquity. For there was neuer ſo great abhomination redde of and ſo quickly to pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uaile, as this abhomination of the wicked maſſe hathe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed in Englande.

               <p>As concerning the party whom you wrote vnto me of, I haue here ſent you mine aduiſe, and what I thynke is beſte in this caſe to be done. Fyrſte ſhe ſhall remember the counſell of S. Paule. 1. Cor. 7. where he ſpeaketh to ſuche as be cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled in matrimoy and be of two ſundry and diuers religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: If the vnbeleuinge man will dwell with the faythfull woman, the wife cannot forſake him. Or in caſe the vnbele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing woman wil dwell with her beleuing huſband, the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band cannot forſake her. But if the vnbeleuing party (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be huſband or wife) will departe, the beleuing partye is at libertye. Now in this time, to beleue that the prieſt can make God, or to beleue that which was not God yeſterday, can be both God and man to daye, &amp; ſo to honor that which was but very bread yeſterdaye, for the true God that made both heauen and earth and al that be in them, and for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoule of Chriſte that ſuffred for oure redemption, and toke from vs our ſinnes vpon the croſſe: is very idolatry &amp; to be committed of no chriſtian man, for the payne of it with out repentance, is euerlaſting dampnation. In matrimonie it is mete therefore, that which partye ſo euer be perſwaded &amp; knoweth the truth, be it the huſband or the wife, the truth be ſpoken, taught, and opend vnto the party that is not per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſwaded. For as Saint Paule ſayeth: howe knoweſt thou O man, whether thou ſhalt ſaue thy wife, or how knoweſt thou O woman, whether thou ſhalt ſaue thy huſband. Therefore let the beſt and more godly partye be diligent in ſauinge (by his or her laboures) the party that is not inſtructed nor per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſwaded in the truth. If it preuayle, then is the worſe part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, and the beſt part hath done his or her duty and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as it is commaunded. <hi>Epheſi.</hi> 4. <hi>Colloſs.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>In caſe the worſe part will not be amended, but tary ſtill in errour, and ſo offend the almighty God the author of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, let the beſte parte that is perſwaded and knoweth the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:9364:79"/>
truth, as in this caſe the woman, labour with her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be free and at liberty, and not to be compelled to honour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny falſe God, or to ſerue God otherwiſe then ſhee knoweth ſhe maye do with a good conſcience, as ſhe is taughte by the word of God. And if ſhe may thus obteyne to be at libertye, and be not compelled to do thinges agaynſt her conſcience, ſhe may not in any wyſe depart from him that ſhe is maried vnto. If this woman cannot wyn her huſband to the truth, nor obtayne to liue freelye and at libertye in the faythe of Chriſte her ſelfe, lette her cauſe ſome godlye and graue men or women to perſwade with her huſbande, as well for hys owne better knowledge, as for the freedome and libertye of her ſelfe, and let her and whoſoeuer entreateth of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, vſe modeſty, ſobernes, and charitye, and pray vnto God that their doinges maye take vertuous and godlye ſucceſſe. In caſe (which God forbidde) the huſband will not reforme himſelf of his error, nor ſuffer his wife to refrain the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and fellowſhip of ſuch as be preſent at the maſſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as an idoll is honored for God: this wyfe muſte make aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere ſoberly and chriſtianly, that ſhe is forbidden by gods lawes to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit Idolatrye,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Actes.</hi> 5. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.</note> and that gods is more to be obey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed then man, and ſo in any caſe beware ſhe offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not againſt the firſte commaundemente whiche is, thou ſhalte haue no other Gods but me. It maye come to paſſe, that when the huſbande ſhall perceaue the wifes loue and reuerence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes him, and alſo her conſtancye and ſtrengthe in the truthe and true religion of GOD, althoughe he be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted vnto the truthe by her, yet he will be contented to ſuffer her to vſe the libertye of her conſcience, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion to any religion that ſhe doth by Gods worde deteſt and abhorre. But if there bee no remedye, but either the wife muſte followe in idolatry her huſbandes commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or elles ſuffer the extremitye of the law: here muſt the wife remember and learne whether there bee anye lawe or not, that can compell her ordinarilye to come to the maſſe, whereas idolatrye is committed. If there be no lawe or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes to compel her then her huſbands foule words, which be nothing els but threatninges to put her in feare, ſhe muſte if ſhe can wyth wiſedome, and womanhode a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:9364:79"/>
the ſame: if ſhe cannot, then muſt ſhe chriſtianly and pacientlye beare them as a woman of God, that for his ſake muſte ſuffer as muche, as hys pleaſure is to lay vpon her. In caſe there be a lawe to compel her and al other, if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe ſhe will not obey to come to the maſſe: firſte ſhe muſte wiſely and diſcretly way her huſbandes nature, whether he is wont to be in deede, workes, and offers, cruell as he is in wordes. If ſhe can fynd that his nature is (as the moſt part of mens be) more churliſh &amp; cruel in words then in workes, then howſoeuer he threatneth by daungerous woordes, he will not accuſe his wife to harme her, but rather excuſe her. In caſe eyther for lacke of loue, or for feare of loſing of hys goodes, ſhe perceaue verely that he mindeth to bring her in daunger by a law: then muſt ſhe pray to God and vſe one of theſe two extreme remedies. Firſt if ſhe finde by prayer her ſelfe ſtrong to abyde the extremity of the lawe, yea though ſhe ſhould dye, let her in no caſe depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her huſband. In caſe ſhe find her ſelf to weake to ſuffer ſuche extremitye, then rather then to breake company and mariage betwene God and her, conioyned by the precious blood of Chriſt, ſhe muſt conuey her ſelf into ſome ſuch place as idolatry may be auoi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded. For if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d loue the wife, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wife the huſband more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt, he nor ſhe be not mete for chriſt. <hi>Math.</hi> 10.16. <hi>Luke.</hi> 14.9.

And ſeing he hath ſuch care for the heares of our head, how much more doth he care for our life it ſelf? wherfore let gods aduerſaryes do what they luſt, whether they take the life or take it not, they can do vs no hurte, for theyr crueltye hath no further power then god permitteth them: and that whiche commeth vnto vs by the wyll of our heauenlye fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, can be no harme, no loſſe, neyther deſtruction vnto vs, but rather gayne, wealth, and felicitye. For all troubles and aduerſity that chaunce to ſuch as be of god,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Iacob.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8.</note> for it is not the nature of man that can be contented vntill it be regenerated and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with gods ſpirite, to beare pacientlye the troubles of the mind or of the body. When the minde and hart of a man ſeeth of euery ſide ſorrowe and heauines, and the worldlye eye beholdeth nothinge but ſuche thinges as be troublous &amp; wholy bent to robbe the poore man of that he hath, &amp; alſo to take from him his lyfe: except the man waigh theſe brittle and vncertayne treaſures that be taken from him, wyth the riches of the life to come, and this life of the bodye wyth the life in Chriſtes precious blood, and ſo for the loue and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teynty of the heauenly ioyes contemne al thinges preſente, doubtles he ſhall neuer be able to beare the loſſe of goods, life, or any other thynges of this world. Therfore S. Paule geueth a verye godlye and neceſſarye leſſon to all menne in thys ſhort &amp; tranſitorye life, and therein ſheweth how a manne maye beſte beare the iniquytye, and troubles of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:9364:82"/>
thys world:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Col.</hi> 3.</note> if ye be riſen agayne wyth Chriſt (ſayth he) ſeke the thynges whiche are aboue, where Chryſte ſitteth at the ryght hand of God the father. Wherfore the chriſtian mans fayth muſt be alwaies vpon the reſurrection of Chriſte whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is in trouble, and in that glorious reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſhal not onelye ſee continuall and perpetuall ioye and conſolation: but alſo the victorye and triumphe of all perſequution, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſynne, death, hell, the diuell, and all other perſequutors, and tyrannes of Chriſte and of Chriſtes people, the teares and weepinges of the faythfull dryed vp, theyre woundes healed, theyr bodies made immortall in ioy, theyr ſoules for euer prayſynge the Lord, and coniunction and ſocietye euer laſting with the bleſſed company of Gods electes in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ioy. But the wordes of S. Paule in that place, if they be not marked, ſhal do little profite to the reader or hearer, and geue him no patience at al in this impacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and cruel world. In the fyrſt part Saynt Paule commaundeth vs to thinke or ſet our affections on things that are aboue. When he bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs ſeke the things that are aboue, he requireth that our mindes neuer ceaſe from prayer and ſtudy in Gods worde, vntyll we ſee, knowe, and vnderſtande the vanities of thys world, the ſhortnes and myſery of this lyfe, &amp; the treaſures of the world to come, the immortality therof, and the ioyes of that life, and ſo neuer ceaſe ſeking, vntill ſuch time as we know certeynly and be perſwaded what a bleſſed man he is that ſeeketh thone and findeth it, and careth not for thother though he loſe it: and in ſeking to haue ryght iudgement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the life preſent, and the life to come, we ſhal find how little the paynes, impriſonment, ſlaunders, lies, and death it ſelfe is in this world, in reſpect of the paynes euerlaſtinge, the priſon infernal, and doungeon of hel, the ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of gods iuſt iudgement, and euerlaſting death.</p>
               <p>When a man hath by ſeeking the word of God, found out what the thinges aboue be: then muſt he (as Saynte Paule ſaythe) ſet his affections vpon them. And this commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is more hard then thother. For mans knowlege ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times ſeeth the beſte, and knoweth that there is a lyfe to come better then this life preſent, as you may ſe how dayly men and women can prayſe and commend, yea and wyſh for heauen and to be at reſt there, yet they ſet not theyr affection
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:9364:82"/>
vpon it, they do more affect &amp; loue in dede a trifel of nothing in this worlde that pleaſeth theyr affection, then a treaſure of all treaſures in heauen, whiche their owne iudgemente ſayeth is better then all worldlye thinges. Wherefore we muſt ſet our affections vpon the things that be aboue: that is to ſay, when any thyng worſe then heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon the earth offereth it ſelfe to be ours, yf we wyll geue our good willes to it and loue it in our heartes: then to ſee by the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of gods word, whether we may haue the world w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of god, and ſuch thynges as be for this worldly lyfe, wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his diſpleaſure. If we cannot, S. Paules commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt take plate: ſet your affection on thinges that are aboue. If the riches of this worlde maye not be gotten nor kepte with gods law, neyther our lyues be continued with out the denyall of hys honour, we muſt ſet our affection v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the riches and lyfe that is aboue, and not vpon things that be on the earth. Therfore this ſecond commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of S. Paule requireth, that as our myndes iudge heauenly thinges to be better then thinges vppon the earth, and the lyfe to come better then the life preſent: ſo we ſhould chooſe them before other, &amp; preferre the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and haue ſuche affection to the beſt, that in no caſe we ſet the worſt before it, as the moſt part of the world doth, and hathe done, for they chooſe the beſt and approue it, and yet follow the worſt.</p>
               <p>But theſe things (my godly wife) requyre rather cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, meditation and prayer, then wordes or talke. They be eaſy to be ſpoken of but not ſo eaſy to be vſed and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Wherfore ſeyng they bee gods giftes and none of ours to haue as our own when we would, we muſt ſeke them at our heauenly fathers hande, who ſeeth and is priuye howe poore and wretched we be, and how naked, how ſpoyled &amp; deſtitute of all his bleſſed giftes we bee, by reaſon of ſinne. He dyd commaunde therfore his diſciples, when he ſhewed them that they ſhould take patiently the ſtate of this preſent life ful of troubles &amp; perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">Math. <hi>24.</hi> Luke. ij</note> to pray that they might wel eſcape thoſe troubles that were to come, and be able to ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d before the ſonne of man.

Howe be it no man of hym ſelfe can do this, but the ſpirit of god that ſtriketh the mans hart with feare,<note place="margin">

               <p>Hereof may the chriſtian man learne both conſolation &amp; patience. Conſolation, in that he is compelled bothe in hys bodye and goodes to feele payne and loſſe, and in the ſoule heauines and anguiſh of mynde: how be it none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both ſhall ſeparate him from the loue that God beareth hym in Chriſt. He may learne patience, for as much as his enemies both of the body and ſoule, and the paines alſo they vexe vs withal for the time, if they tary with vs as long as we liue, yet when death commeth they ſhal auoide and geue place to ſuch ioyes as be prepared for vs in Chriſt: for no paynes of the worlde be perpetuall, and whether they ſhall afflicte vs for all the tyme of our mortall lyfe, we knowe not, for they be the ſeruauntes of god to go and to come, as he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them. But we muſt take hede we meddle not forceably nor ſeditiouſly, to put away the perſecution appointed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs by God, but remember Chriſtes ſaying:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke.</hi> 2</note> poſſeſſe you your liues by your patience. And in this commaundement, god requireth in euery man and woman this patient obedi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ence. He ſayeth not, it is ſufficient that other holye Patry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arckes, Prophetes Apoſtles, Euangeliſtes and Martyrs continued theyr lyues in patience and pacient ſufferyng the troubles of this worlde: but Chriſte ſayeth to euerye one of his people, by your owne patience ye ſhall continue your lyfe: not that man hathe patience of hym ſelfe, but that he muſt haue it for hymſelfe of God, the onelye geuer of it, if he purpoſe to be a godly man. Now therfore, as our profeſſion and religion requireth patience outwardlye withoute reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce and force: ſo requireth it patience of the mynde, and not to be angrye wyth God, althoughe he vſe vs that be his own creatures, as him liſteth. We may not alſo mur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mure againſt God, but ſay alwais his iudgements be right &amp; iuſt, and reioyce that it pleaſeth him by troubles to vſe vs as he vſed heretofore ſuche as he moſt loued in this worlde, &amp; haue a ſynguler eare to this commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: <hi>Gaudete &amp; exultate,</hi> be glad &amp; reioyce, for he ſheweth great cauſe why:<note place="margin">

of hym that is the truth it ſelfe, ſhall (by gods grace) worke both conſolation &amp; patience in the afflicted chriſtian perſon. And when our ſauiour Chriſt hath willed men in trouble to be content and pacient, becauſe god in the ende of trouble in Chriſt hath ordeyned eternall conſolation: he vſeth alſo to take from vs all ſhame and rebuke, as thoughe it were not an honour to ſuffer for Chriſte, becauſe the wycked worlde dothe curſe and abhorre ſuche poore troubled Chriſtians. Wherfore Chriſt placeth all his honourably,<note place="margin">

And as man looketh for the nutrimente of his meate when it is full digeſted, and not before: ſo muſt he looke for his ſaluation when he hathe paſſed this troublous world, and not before. Rawe fleſhe is not meate wholeſom for man: and vnmortified men and women, be no creatures mete for God. Therfore Chriſt ſaith,<note place="margin">

And it ſhall be a chriſtian mans part, and the duetye of a mynde repleniſhed with the ſpirite of God, to marke the order of god in all his thynges, how he dealeth with them, and how they ſuffer and be content to let god do hys wil vpon them: As S.

               <p>We muſt therfore patiently ſuffer, and willingly attend vpon gods doings, although they ſeme cleane contrary af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our iudgement, to our wealth and ſaluation: as Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham dyd when he was hyd to offer his ſonne Iſaac, in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god promyſed the bleſſing &amp; multiplyeng of his ſede.

The worlde is ſtarke blynde, and more foliſhe then foliſhnes it ſelfe, and ſo be the people of the world. For when god ſaith trouble ſhal come, they will haue eaſe. And when God ſayeth be merye and reioyce in trouble, we lamente and mourne, as though we were caſtawais. But this the fleſh (which is neuer mery with vertue, nor ſory with vice, neuer laugheth with grace, nor euer weepeth with ſinne) holdeth faſt with the world, &amp; letteth god ſlip. But (my dearely beloued wyfe) you knowe how to perceaue and to beware, of the vanitye and craftes of the diuel well inough in Chriſt.

And where as thys effecte of confeſſion of faythe is not, there wanteth alſo the cauſe of confeſſion, whiche is true faythe: for as the tree is knowen by her fruites, ſo is faythe by her effectes. And as the wante of fruite is a demonſtration that the tree is vnprofitable: ſo the wante of true confeſſion of faythe, is a token that the faith is dead. The ende of the vnprofitable tree,<note place="margin">Math. x. <hi>1.</hi> Pet. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> is cuttyng down and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtynge into the fyre: the ende of the fruitles faythe is death and caſtyng to eternall dampnation.

reuerence, which is a very teſtimony that we ſanctify god in our hartes, as it is before expreſſed in the ſame chapter. For the greateſt honour that man can geue to god, is to confeſſe in the tyme of trouble, truly and faithfully hys holy worde and fayth. Wherfore it is the duty of euery chriſtian, to pray &amp; ſtudy to haue a through knowledge of his faith in Chriſt, and as the glory of god ſhall requyre, &amp; the cauſe of his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to bee readye to make aunſwere for the ſame (howe ſoeuer the world, feare, diſpleaſure, frendſhip, or other lettes ſhall moue vs to the contrary) vppon payne, ſaieth Chriſte in the x,<note place="margin">Math. x.</note> of Mathew, that I will deny hym before my father which is in heauen. But how harde a thyng it is to confeſſe Chriſte in the dayes of trouble, not onely the ſcripture, but alſo daily experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in good men and women doth declare. True confeſſion is warded on euery ſide, with many daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, on the righte hande and on the lefte hande, now with fayre meanes, then wyth foule threatnynges, fearefull and daungerous: as it is ſayde by Chriſte our Sauioure, they ſhall betray you to the iudges, and of them ye ſhall be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and iudged to deathe. Of the other ſyde ſhall pull vs backe the loue of wyfe, childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, brother, Syſter, kin, frends, and the loue vnto our ſelues. But he that is ouercommen by any of theſe meanes, hath his iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: he is not meete for me ſayth Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe thynges be impoſſible vnto men, yet to chriſtian men, in Chriſt poſſible, and ſo neceſſary, that chriſtianity and true religion cannot bee in hym, that is a fearde to confeſſe Chriſt and his goſpell in the tyme of perſecution. The wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the world doth ſay, although I accompliſhe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyre of my frendes, and to the ſight of the worlde am preſent at the maſſe, and with my body do as other men do, or as I may do: yet my hart is clean contrary to their belief, &amp; I do deteſt ſuch Idolatry &amp; beleue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the thing that I am preſent at, is mere idolatry, and abhominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Here be fayre words for an euill purpoſe, and pretenced excuſe, for a iuſt condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation before God. For if it be true that ye know the thing which ye reſort vnto, to be the diſhonor of god, why doe ye honour it with your preſence? If ye know it to be euil, why refrayne ye not from it? If your conſcience ſaye it is Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, why ſerueth your body ſuch things as your fayth ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth? If in your hart you know but one God, why with
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:9364:86"/>
your exterior preſence, ſerue ye the thing that ye knowe is not God? If your fayth ſee idolatrye, why doth your ſilence co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe and allow the ſame? Two me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in one, god loueth not. If the inwarde man knowe the truth, why doth the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man confeſſe a falſehode? If your ſpirite be perſwaded that the maſſe is idolatry, why do ye with your bodely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, vſe it as a God and geue godly honoure to it? Do ye not perceaue that it is written <hi>Eſay.</hi> 25. <hi>Math.</hi> 15. theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple honor me with theyr mouth, but their harts be farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me? The cauſe why God was offended with theſe people, was that outwardly they confeſſed him &amp; ſerued him, but their hartes were farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him inwardly. Wherfore ye may ſee what it is to beare two faces in one hoode, outwardly to ſerue God, and inwardly to ſerue the deuil. Now marke of thys place, if it be ſo horrible &amp; damnable a thing to be falſe in the hart, which none knoweth but God, and is worthy alſo of damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: what is to be iudged of the outward and manifeſt vſe of idolatry, which not only God, but alſo euery good man knoweth and abhorreth? There is no coulor, nor cloked hipocriſie, that God ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away with. If the hart thinke not as the tong ſpeaketh, or els y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tong ſpeake otherwiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hart thinketh, both be abhominable before God.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.</note> Read ye the .3. and the .6. Chapters of the fyrſt Epiſtle of S. Paul to the Corinth, where as S. Paule ſayth: know ye not that your bodie is the temple of the holy ghoſt? If your body be the temple of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoſt, what agrement hath it with ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry? Can one body at one time, bee the temple of the holy ghoſt, and be preſent at ſuch idolatry as god abhorreth and deteſteth? Can a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſerue two maſters? If he do, he loueth (as Chriſt ſaith) the one and hateth the other.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 6.</note> As god requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of a faithful man, a pure hart: euen ſo requyreth he that his external profeſſion in al thinges be according therunto, for both body and ſoule be detters vnto god, &amp; he redemed them both. The woorde of God ſayth vnto vs,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.</note> glorifye and beare God in your bodies. If we be preſent at ſuch idolatry as God forbiddeth, and our own knowledge in conſcience is aſſured to be euill, do we glorifye God in our bodies? No doutleſſe we diſhonour him, and make our bodyes the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes of idolatry, not only to Gods diſhonoure, but alſo to the great daunger both of body and ſoule. For this is a
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:9364:87"/>
true ſaying of S. Auguſtine, he that doth againſt his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, buildeth to hell fyre.</p>
               <p>It is not enough for a Chriſtian man to ſay, I know the maſſe is nought, but to obey ciuill lawes and orders I wil do outwardly as other men do, yet in my hart abhorre it &amp; neuer thinke it to be good. Doutleſſe theſe two mindes, the ſpirite to thinke wel &amp; the body to do euil, in this reſpect be both naught, &amp; god wil ſpue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whole ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of his mouth, as he did y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miniſter of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Laodicia. Apo. 3. The 8. chap. &amp; the .10 of the fyrſt to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Corinthians in thys matter &amp; in this time, be places very muche expedient to lead &amp; go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the iudgement of euery Chriſtian ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: where we may ſee that the Corinthians in dede had knowlege &amp; perceaued right well that neither the idoles amongeſt them, neyther the meate dedicated vnto the idoles were any thing, &amp; paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as light of both, as of thinges of nothing, &amp; vppon that knowledge vſed to be preſent and alſo to eate at the feaſt, &amp; of the meate dedicated vnto Idoles. Wherewithall Paule was ſo ſore offended, that he gaue this ſentence: if a man ſee thee which haſt knowledge,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8</note> ſit at table in the Idoles te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſhal not the conſcience of him which is weake, be bolde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to eate thoſe things which are ſacrificed to Idoles? and through thy knowledge ſhall the weake brother periſh, for who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt died. Now when ye ſinne ſo againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> brethren, and wound their weake conſcience, ye ſinne againſt Chriſt. This iudgement of Paul is more to be followed, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al our own fayned and wreſted defences, which would fayne ſeme to do wel, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we halt on both ſides, which god abhorreth. Paule hath a profounde &amp; depe conſideration of that mans fault that hath knowledge, &amp; perceaueth his diſſimulation to be dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous &amp; perilous to al perſons which he dwelleth with al. Firſt ſuch as be of a right and ſtayed iudgement and will not proſtrate their bodies to an Idole, do condemne, &amp; nedes muſt, ſuch diſſimulation. The very Idolaters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, haue a defence of their abhomination, by the preſence of him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knoweth to haue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. The weaker ſort y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> would gladly take the beſt way, by a diſſemblers halting &amp; playing of both handes, embraceth both in body and in ſoule, the euil that he abhorreth in hys
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:9364:87"/>
hart, and though he haue knowledge, yet with his preſence he eſtemeth it as other do which haue no knowledge. If S Paule ſayd y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the weake brother doth periſh for who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt died, by him that abuſed knowledge in meates and drinkes that of themſelues be indifferent: how muche more by the knowledge of him that vſeth manifeſte Idolatry forbidden of God as a thing not indifferent? Take hede what ſ. Paule meaneth, and what he would proue againſt this man which had knowledge that neither the Idoles neither y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meates dedicated to Idoles were any thing. Forſooth this would he proue: that a poore man that wanteth knowledge, by the example of him that hath knowledge, doth there aduenture to do euil, which he would not do in caſe he ſawe not thoſe that he hath good opinion of, to go before him as authors of the euill. And in dede the ignoraunte people, or thoſe that be halfe perſwaded in a truth, yea or els throughly per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſwaded what is euill, when they haue any notable men or women for an example to follow, they thinke in following of them, they be excuſed, yea although peraduenture they do it againſt their conſciences: as ye may ſee how many good men by the example of Peter began to diſſemble, yea Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas hymſelfe the Apoſtle of the Gentiles.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gala.</hi> 2</note> But how great offence this is before god, ſo to make a doubtful co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience or ſtriuig againſt knowledge to do any thing that is not god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, let the iudgement of men paſſe, and meaſure it from gods word. Chriſt ſayth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 18</note> it were better a milſtone were hanged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſuch an offenders necke, &amp; caſt into the ſea. And dout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the payne muſt be the greater, bycauſe we geue offence willingly, and agaynſt our owne conſciences: and thys be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God is a wicked knowledge that cauſeth an other to periſhe. Woe be vnto hym that is learned to bring his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to deſtruction. Doth a Chriſtian man know the truth to bring his brother to a lye? For thoſe weaklinges that we make to ſtomble, Chriſt died, as S. Paul ſayth. God defend we ſhould confyrme any mans conſeience in euil. Let euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of god waye with himſelfe the doctrine of S. Paul that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth vs to flye Idolatrye.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10</note> And marke what ſ. Paul in that place calleth Idolatrye. It is to be ſene plainly y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:9364:88"/>
ſpeaketh not of ſuch idolatry as men that lacke knowledge in their hartes what god is and &amp; what god is not, do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. For in the .8. chapter before he ſayth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> men knowe that the idoles were no gods, and that although by name y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles had many gods, yet they knew that there was but one god. Therfore he meaneth nothing by this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement, fly idolatry, but to auoyd ſuch rites, ceremonies, and vſages, as outwardly wer vſed in the honour &amp; reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the idoles y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wer no gods, and waying the right vſe of the Lords ſupper and the dignitie therof, with the manner and vſe of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles towards their gods, he would bring the church of the Corrinthians to vnderſtand how that, as the diuine and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate rites, ceremonies and vſe of the ſacrament of Chriſtes body and blood, did ſanctifye him and declare hym that vſed it to be the ſeruaunt and child of God: ſo dyd the rites &amp; ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes of the Gentiles defile the vſers therof, and decla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red them to be the ſeruauntes and children of the idole, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that they knew in their harts y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> idole was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. God by his ſacrament doth couple vs vnto him: let vs pray therfore to him that we pollute not our ſelues with any rites, ceremonies, or vſages not inſtituted by god, and ſo diuide our ſelues from him.</p>
               <p>In this cauſe, if a faithful man ſhould be at the maſſe, it is to be conſidered with what mind thoſe that he doth there accompany himſelfe withal, do come thyther, and what the ende is of the worke that the prieſt doth. The people come to honour the bread and wine for god, and the prieſt purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to conſecrate bothe god and man, and ſo to offer Chriſte to the father for remiſſion of ſinne. Nowe do they that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne them ſelues vnto thoſe people, profeſſe and declare a ſocietie and fellowſhip of the ſame impietye, as ſ. Paul layd to the Corrinthians charge. S. Paule was not offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded with the Corinthians bicauſe they lacked knowledge of the true God, but bicauſe contrary to their knowledge, they aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues with idolaters. For this is true, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in al rites, ſacraments &amp; honorings, whether they be of god or of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil, there is a profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a communion: ſo that euery man proteſteth to be of the ſame religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the reſt be of, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be perta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kers w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him. I know there be many euaſions made by men, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> iudge a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may with ſauegard of conſcience be at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maſſe. But foraſmuch as M, Caluine, M. Bullynger and other

Then ſaid I, my Lorde I thynke manye thinges be farre wyde from the truth of Gods word in that booke. Then my lord ſayd, thou art a very varlet.

               <p>Then my Lorde Chauncelour ſaide, thou ſayeſt that prieſtes maye be maryed by gods lawe, howe proueſt thou that? I aunſwered by the playne wordes and ſentences of S.

Chryſoſtome writing vpon the Epiſtle to Timothy, ſaithe: it is an hereſy to ſay that a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop may not be maried. Then my lorde Chauncellour ſaid thou lyeſt of Chriſoſtome, but thou doeſt as all thy compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions do, belye euer without al ſhame, both the ſcriptures &amp; the doctors. Diddeſt thou not alſo ſaye, that by the Cannon law prieſtes may be maried? which is moſt vntrue and the contrary is moſt true. I anſwered, we reade in the decrees, that the fower generall counſels, Nicene, Conſtantinopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litane, Epheſme and Calcedon, haue the ſame autoritye that the foure Euangeliſtes haue. And we reade in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, which is one of the chiefe bookes of the Canon lawe, that the Councell of Nice, by the meanes of one Paphnu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, dyd allowe Prieſtes and biſhops mariages: therefore by the beſt part of the Canon law, prieſtes may be maryed. Then my Lorde Chauncellor ſaid, thou falſifieſt the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall councel: for there is expreſſe mention in the ſaid decree that prieſts ſhould be diuorced from their wyues which be

maried. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſayd I, if thoſe words be there as you ſay, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> am I content to loſe thys great head of myne: let y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> booke be fetched. Then ſayd my lord of Dureſme, thoughe they bee not there, yet they may be in <hi>Eccleſiaſtica hiſtoria,</hi> which Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius wrote, out of which boke the decree was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Then ſayd I, it is not like that the pope would leaue out any ſuch ſentence, hauing ſuch authoritie. &amp; making ſo much for hys purpoſe. Then my lord Chauncelor ſayd, Gracian was but a patcher, and thou art glad to ſnatch vp ſuch a patch as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth for thy purpoſe. I aunſwered, my Lord I can not but maruaile that you do cal one of the chiefe papiſtes that euer was, but a patcher. Then my lord Chauncelor ſayd, Nay I call thee a ſnatcher &amp; a patcher. To make an end, wilte thou not returne againe with vs to the Catholike church? and w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that he roſe.

fedde at Chriſtes hand with fyue thouſand, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth you not to ſeeke the meate that peryſheth, you depart. The children of Iſraell were muche to be blamed, for that they deſired to be in Egipt agayne, and yet was their lacke and laboure then more in deſerte then yours in London. Alas wretched man what hath cauſed thee thus to caſte awaye thy ſelfe once knowing the truth, and to take in hande to be a miniſter in Antichriſtes Church? Arte thou ſo ſone wery of the heauenly Manna and ſo readye to returne to thy olde vomite agayne? we thought thou haddeſt beene ſo cleane eſcaped through the woorde of grace, that thou haddeſt bene a worthy man, to be a comforte to them that ſtand, a ſuccour to the weake, and an helpe to them that fall: and art thou now roled in thy filthye pudle agayn, and art become an helper to put other into the ſame? Oh more then damnable doings, the forgeuenes wherof farre paſſeth the hope of man. And were it not that things impoſſible to man are poſſible with God, we ſhoulde vtterly deſpayre of thy returne.

To fall is a thing annexed to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupte nature of man, but to lye ſtill in the filthye puddle of perdition, is to deſpiſe God the authour and fyrſt maker of nature.

To wyncke at the bryght<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Sunne, is a weakenes of the eyes, but to flye the light is to be of the nyght.

               <p>That god geueth you ſo contrite a harte for your ſinnes, I can not but reioyce to behold the liuely marke of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of god, whoſe propertye is to thinke more lowlye and vily of themſelues, then of any other, and often tymes doe ſet their ſinnes before them, that they myghte the more bee ſtyrred to bryng forth the fruites of repentaunce, and learne to mourne in thys worlde that in an other they myghte bee glad and reioyce. Such a broken heart is a pleaſaunt ſacry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyce vnto God: O that I had the lyke contrite harte. God mollifye my ſtonye harte, which lamenteth not in ſuch wiſe my former deteſtable iniquities. Praiſed be god that he hath geuen you thys ſorrowful hart in reſpect of righteouſnes, &amp; I praye you let me be pertaker of theſe Godly ſorrowes for ſinne, which be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> teſtimony of the preſence of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoſte. Dyd not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſword of ſorrow pearce the harte of the elect and bleſſed mother of our Lord? Did not Peter wepe bitterly for hys ſinnes which was ſo beloued of Chriſt?

Loke therfore that you continue a faithfull ſyſter as you are called and are godlye entered, not onely to me but to all the churche of Chriſte, yea to Chriſt hymſelf, who voucheth you in this your vnfained faith, worthy to be his ſiſter.

attend, heare, and read the holy ſcriptures, labour after our vocation to amend our brethren.

Howbeit, neuer for any thing reſiſte, or ryſe agaynſt the Magiſtrates: auenge not your ſelues, but committe your cauſe to the lord to whom vengeaunce per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth, and he in his time wil reward it. If ye feele in your ſelues an hope &amp; truſt in god, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he will neuer tempte you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue that he will make you able to beare, be aſſured y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lorde wil be true to you, and ye ſhal bee able to beare al bruntes.

Geue hym thys honour, which of all other thynges he moſt chieflye requireth at your handes, namely beleue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye are his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through Chriſt: that he is your father &amp; God through him: that he loueth you, pardoneth you al your of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences: that he is with you in trouble, &amp; wil be with you for euer.

               <p>Therfore be aſhamed to thinke, ſpeake, or doe any thyng that ſhould be vnſemely for Gods children, Gods ſaintes, Chriſtes member &amp;c.

And alas, how haſt thou offended? Yea how doſt thou ſtil offend? Wilt thou conſider things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the outward ſhew? Was not the Sinagoge more ſeemely &amp; like to the true churche, then the ſimple flocke of

Chriſtes Diſciples? Hath not the whore of Babilon more coſtly aray and riche apparel externally to ſet forth her ſelf, then the homely houſewife of Chriſt? Where is the beautye of the Kinges doughter the Church of Chriſt? Withoute or within? Doth not Dauid ſay within? Oh remember that as they are happy which are not offended at Chriſt, ſo are they happy which are not offended at his poore church. Can the pope &amp; his prelates meane honeſtly which make ſo much of the wife, and ſo litle of the huſband? The churche they mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, but Chriſt they contemne. If this church were an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (that is Chriſtes wife) except they woulde make much of her huſband Chriſt and hys word, ſhe would not be made much of, of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt and his Apoſtles wer vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, who was more like to be the true church? They, or the prelates, biſhops and Sinagoge? If a man ſhoulde haue followed cuſtome, vnity, antiquitie or the more parte, ſhould not Chriſt and his company haue bene caſt out of the dores? Therfore badde Chriſt: ſearch y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcriptures. And good Mother, ſhal the ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t be aboue his maiſter? ſhal we loke for other intertainemente at the handes of the worlde, then Chriſt and his deare Diſciples founde? Who was taken in Noes time for the church? Poore Noe and his family, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? Who was taken for gods church in Sodome? Lot, or others? And doth not Chriſt ſay: as it went then ſo ſhall it go now towardes the comming of the ſonne of man? What meaneth Chriſt when he ſaith, iniquitie ſhal haue the vpper hand, doth he not tel that charitie ſhal waxe colde? And who ſeeth not a wonderfull great lacke of charitie in thoſe which would now be taken for Chriſtes church? All that feare god in this Realme truly, can tel more of this, then I can write.</p>
               <p>Therfore dere Mother, receaue ſome admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of one of thy poore children now going to be burned for the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Ieſus. Come agayne to Gods truth: come out of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilon: confeſſe Chriſt and his true doctrine: repent y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whiche is paſt: make amendes by declaring thy repentaunce by the fruites. Remember the readinges and preachings of Gods Prophet and true preacher Martyne Bucer. Call to mynde the threatninges of God, nowe ſome thynge ſeene by thy children Leauer, and others. Let the exile of Leauer, Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinton, Gryndall, Haddon, Horne, Scorye, Pouet &amp;c,

And nowe caſt not awaye the poore admonition of me going to be burned alſo, &amp; to receaue the like crowne of glorye with my fellowes. Take to harte Gods callyng by vs. Be not as Pharao was, for then wil it happen vnto thee as it dyd vnto hym. What is that? Hardeneſſe of hart. And what then? Deſtruction eternally both of bodye and ſoule. Ah therefore good Mother awake, awake, repente, repent, buſtell thy ſelf and make haſte to turne to the Lord, for elles it ſhal be more eaſye for Sodome and Gomorre in the day of iudgement, then for thee. Oh harden not your harts: Oh ſtop not your eares to day in hearing gods voice, though it be by me a moſt vnworthye meſſenger. Oh feare the Lord, for his anger is begonne to kindle. Euen now the are is layde to the roote of the tree. Ye know I prophecyed truely to you before the ſwet came, what woulde come if ye repented not you carnall goſpelling, and now I tel you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I depart hence, that the eares of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil tingle to heare of the vengeaunce of God that will fal vppon you all, both towne and vniuerſitie, if ye repente not, if ye leaue not your Idolatry, if ye tourne not ſpedely to the Lord, if ye ſtil be aſhamed of Chriſtes truth whiche ye knowe. Oh Perne repent, Oh Thomſon repente, Oh ye Doctors, Bachelors and Maiſters repent, Oh Maior Aldermen, &amp; towne dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers repente, repente, repente that ye maye eſcape the nere vengeaunce of the Lord. Rent your harts, and come apace calling on the Lord. Let vs al ſay, <hi>Peccauimus,</hi> we haue ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, we haue done wickedlye, we haue not harkened to thy voyce O Lord. Deale not with vs after our deſerts, but be merciful to our iniquities, for they are great. Oh pardon vs our offences: In thyne anger remember thy mercy. Turne vs vnto thee O Lorde God of hoſtes, for the glorye of thy names ſake: ſpare vs, and be mercifull vnto vs. Let not the wicked people ſay: wher is now their god? Oh for thine own ſake, for thy names ſake deale mercifully w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vs. Turne thy ſelf vnto vs, and vs vnto thee, and we ſhall prayſe thy name for euer.</p>

Though we wepe in the morning, yet at night we ſhal haue our ſorow to ceaſe, for he is exora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, &amp; hath no pleaſure in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of a ſinner: he rather wold our conuerſion and turning. Oh turne you nowe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert, yet once againe I humbly beſech you, &amp; then the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen ſhall draw nygh. The eye hath not ſene, the eare hath not heard, nor the harte of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is able to conceaue the ioyes prepared for vs if we repente, amende oure liues, and hartely turne to the Lord. But if ye repente not, but be as ye were, and goe on forwardes with the wicked, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the faſhion of the world, the Lord will lead you on with wicked doers, ye ſhall peryſhe in your wickednes, youre blood will be vppon your owne heades, your part ſhall be with hipocrites, where ſhall be wepyng and gnaſhyng of teeth, ye ſhall be caſte from the face of the Lorde for euer and euer, eternall ſhame, ſorrow, woe, and miſery ſhall be both in body and ſoule to you worlde without end. Oh therfore, ryght deare to me in the Lord, turne you, turne you, repent you, repent you, amend, amend your liues, departe from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, do good, follow peace and purſue it.

I do not excuſe but accuſe my ſelfe before god and all his church, that I haue greuouſlye offended my Lorde god, I haue not lyued hys goſpell as I ſhoulde haue done.

And therfore (my dearely beloued) reioyce, reioyce and geue tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes with me &amp; for me, that euer god did vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe ſo great a benefit to our countrey, as to chooſe the moſt vnworthy (I meane my ſelfe) to be one, in whom it woulde pleaſe him to ſuffer any kynde of affliction, much more thys violent kynd of death which I perceiue is prepared for me emongs you for his ſake. Al glory &amp; praiſe be geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto god our father for hys excedynge greate mercye towardes me through Ieſus Chriſt our lord.</p>
               <p>But perchaunce ye wil ſay vnto me, what is the cauſe for the which you are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned? we heare ſay that you deny al prefe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Chriſt in his holy ſupper, &amp; ſo make it a bare ſigne &amp; common bread &amp; nothing els. My derely beloued, what is ſaid of me &amp; wil be, I cannot tel. It is told me that M. Pen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dleton is gone down to preach w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you, not as he hath reca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted (for ye al know how he hath preached contrary to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was wont to preach afore I came amongs you) but to reca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that which he hath reca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted. How he wil ſpeake of me &amp; report be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore I come, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I am come, &amp; when I am burned, I much paſſe not: for he y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> is ſo vncertain &amp; wil ſpeake ſo ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt him ſelfe, I cannot thinke he wil ſpeake wel of me, except it make for his purpoſe &amp; profit. But of this enough. In dede the chiefe thing which I am condemned for as an heretyke is, becauſe I deny the ſacrament of the altar (whiche is not chriſtes ſupper, but a plaine peruertyng of it, beyng vſed as
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:9364:141"/>
the papiſts now vſe it) to be a real, natural, &amp; corporall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of chriſtes body &amp; blood vnder the formes &amp; accidents of bread and wine: that is, becauſe I deny tranſubſtantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is the derling of the deuil and doughter and heyre to Antichriſts religion, wherby the Maſſe is mainteyned, chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtes ſupper peruerted, his ſacrifice &amp; croſſe imperfected, hys prieſthode deſtroyed, the miniſtery taken away, repentance repelled, and al true godlines abandoned. In the ſupper of our lord or ſacrament of chriſtes body and blood, I confeſſe &amp; beleue, that there is a true &amp; very preſence of whole Chriſte god &amp; man, to the faith of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> receauer (but not of the ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der by or loker on) as there is a very true preſence of breade and wine to the ſenſes of him that is pertaker therof. This faith, this doctrine, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fenteth with the word of god &amp; with the true teſtimony of chriſtes Churche (whiche the popyſhe church doth perſecute) will I not forſake, and therefore am I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned as an heretike &amp; ſhalbe burned. But my dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloutd, this truth which I haue taught, ye haue recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, I beleued &amp; do beleue, and therin geue my life: I hope in god ſhall neuer be burned, bound, nor ouercome, but ſhal tryumphe, haue victory and be at liberty, manger the heade of all gods aduerſaries. For there is no counſell againſt the lord, nor no deuiſe of man can be hable to defeate the verity in any other, then in ſuch as be children of vnbeliefe, which haue no loue to the truth, and therefore are geuen vp to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue lies. From which plague the lorde of mercies delyuer you and all this realme, my deare hartes in the Lorde, I humblye beeſeche hys mercye, Amen. And to the ende ye myght be delyuered from thys plague (ryght deare to me in the Lorde) I ſhall for my farewell wyth you for euer in thys preſente lyfe, hartely deſyre you all in the bowels and bloode of oure moſte mercifull Sauioure Ieſus Chriſt, to attende vnto theſe thynges, whiche nowe I ſhall ſhortlye wryte vnto you out of the Holy ſcriptures of the Lorde.

Longe did the lord lynger &amp; tary to haue ſhewed mercye vppon vs, but we were euer the longer, the worſe. Therfore moſt iuſtly hathe God dealt with vs, and dealeth with vs. Yea, yet we may ſee, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his iuſtice is tempered with much mercy: wherto let vs attribute that we are not vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſumed: for if the lord ſhould deale with vs after oure deſerts (alas) how could we abide it? In his anger therfore, ſeyng he doth remember hys mercy vndeſerued, yea vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyred on our behalfe, let vs take occaſion the more ſpedelye to go out to mete him, not with force and armes, for we are not ſo able to withſtand hym, much leſſe to preuaile againſt hym: but to beſeche hym to be mercifull vnto vs, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted mercy to deale with vs. Let vs ariſe with Dauyd and ſay: <hi>Ne intres in iudicium cum ſeruo tuo. &amp;c.</hi> Enter not into iudgement (oh Lorde) with thy ſeruant, for in thy ſight no fleſh liuyng ſhall be iuſtifyed. Let vs ſend ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors wyth the Centurion and ſay, Lord we are not worthy to come our ſelues vnto thee, ſpeake the worde and we ſhal haue peace. Let vs penite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly with the Publicane loke down on the earth, knocke our hard hartes to burſt them, and cry out: oh god be merciful vnto vs wretched ſynners. Let vs with the loſt ſonne returne and ſay, O father we haue ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt heauen and earth &amp; before thee, we are vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be called thy children. Let vs (I ſay) do on this ſort, that is, hartely repente vs of our former euill lyfe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefull goſpelling paſt, conuert &amp; turne to god with our whole hartes, hopyng in hys great mercy through Chriſt, and hartelye calling vppon his holye name, and then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly we ſhall fynde and feele otherwyſe then yet we fele, both inwardly and outwardly.

Now is the axe layed to the roote of the tree, vtterlye to deſtroye the impenitent. Now is the fyer gone out before the face of the Lorde, and who is able to quench it? Oh therefore repente you, repente you. It is enough to haue lyued as we haue done. It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to haue played the wanton goſpellers, the proud pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teſtantes, hypocriticall &amp; falſe Chriſtians, as (alas) we haue done. Now the lorde ſpeaketh vnto vs in mercy and grace: oh turne before he ſpeake in wrath. Yet is there mercy with the lorde and plenteous redemption: yet hath he not forgot<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten to ſhew mercy to them that cal vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hym: oh then cal v<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pon him while he may be founde, for he is rich in mercy and plentiful to al them that cal vpon him: ſo that he that calleth vpon the name of the lord ſhalbe ſaued. If your ſinnes be as red as ſkarlet, the Lord ſaith he wil make them as white as ſnow. He hath ſworne and neuer will repente hym thereof, that he wyll neuer reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber our iniquities, but as he is god faithfull and true: ſo will he be our God, and we ſhalbe his people. Hys law wyll he wryte in oure hartes, and engraft it in oure myndes, and neuer wyll he haue in mynde oure vnryghteouſnes.</p>
               <p>Therfore my dere hartes in the Lord, turne you, turne you to the lorde your father, to the lorde your Sauiour, to the Lorde your comforter.

God therfore now is come as you haue heard me preach, and becauſe he will not da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pne vs with the worlde, he beginneth to punyſhe vs: as me for my carnal liuing. For as for my preaching, I am moſte cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne it is and was gods truth, and I truſt to geue my life for it by gods grace, but becauſe I liued not the goſpel tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but outwardly, therefore doth he thus punyſhe me: naye rather in puniſhing bleſſe me. And in dede I thanke hym more of this priſon, then of any parler, yea then of any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that euer I had: for in it I fynde God my moſte ſweete good god alwayes. The fleſh is puniſhed, fyrſt to admoniſh vs now hartilye to liue as we profeſſe, ſecondlye to certifye the wicked of their iuſte dampnation, if they repent not.</p>
               <p>Perchaunce you are infirmed &amp; weakened of that which I haue preached, becauſe god doth not defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it (as you thinke) but ſuffereth the olde popiſhe doctrine to come agayne and preuaile: but you muſte knowe good Mother, that God by this doth proue and trye his children and people whether they wil vnfainedly and ſimplie hang on him &amp; his woord. So did he with the Iſraelites, bringing them into a deſerte, after their comming out of Egipt, where (I meane the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes) was want of al things in compariſon of that which they had in Egipt. Chriſte when he came into thys worlde, brought no worldly wealth nor quietnes with him, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther warre: the worlde (ſayeth he) ſhall reioyce,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 16.</note> but ye ſhall mourne &amp; weepe, but your weping ſhal be tourned into ioy: and therfore happy are they that mourne and weepe, for they ſhal be comforted. They are marked then with gods marke in their foreheades and not with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beaſtes marke, I meane the Popes ſhauen crowne, who now with his ſhauelinges reioyce, but woe vnto them, for they ſhall be caſt down, they ſhall weepe and mourne. The riche Glutton had here hys ioy, and Lazarus ſorrow, but afterwards the time was chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged. The end of carnal ioy is ſorrowe. Nowe let the whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger ioy, with the dronckard, ſwearer, couetous, mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:9364:155"/>
and blynd buſſard Syr Iohn: for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Maſſe wil not bite them, neither make them to bluſhe as preaching woulde. Nowe maye they doe what they will, come deuills to the Church and go deuils home, for no man muſte fynde fault. And they are glad of thys: now haue they theyr hartes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyre, as the Sodomites had when Loth was gone, but what followed? Forſoth when they cryed peace all ſhall be well, then came Gods vengeaunce, fyre and brymſtone from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and burnte vppe euerye mothers childe: euen ſo deare Mother will it doe to our papiſtes. Wherefore feare God: ſticke to hys woorde though all the worlde woulde ſwarue from it. Dye you muſte once, and when or howe, you can not tell. Dye therefore with Chriſte, ſuffer for ſeruing hym truly &amp; after his word: for ſure may we be y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of al deathes it is moſt to be deſired to dye for gods ſake. This is the moſt ſafe kinde of dying: we can not doubt but that we ſhal go to heauen if we dye for hys names ſake. And that you ſhal dye for hys names ſake, Gods woorde will warrant you, if you ſticke to that whiche GOD by me hath taughte you. You ſhall ſee that I ſpeake as I thynke: for by Gods grace I will drinke before you of thys cuppe if I bee put to it. I doubt not but God wil geue me hys grace, &amp; ſtrengthen me therunto: praye that he wold, and that I refuſe it not. I am at a poynte euen when my Lord God will, to come to hym. Death nor life, pryſon nor pleaſure (I truſt in God) ſhal be able to ſeparate me from my Lord God and his Goſpel. In peace whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no perſecution was, then were you content and glad to heare me: then dyd you beleeue me, and wil you not do ſo now, ſeing I ſpeake that which I truſt by gods grace if nede be, to verefye with my lyfe? Good Mother I write before God to you, as I haue preached before hym. It is gods truth I haue taughte: It is that ſame infallible word wherof he hath ſayd: heauen &amp; earth ſhal paſſe, but my word ſhal not paſſe. The maſſe and ſuch baggage as the falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of god and enemies of Chriſtes croſſe (the papiſtes I ſay) haue brought in againe to poyſon the church of God withal, dyſpleaſeth God highly and is abhominable in his ſyghte. Happye maye he bee whiche of conſcience ſuffereth loſſe of lyfe or goodes in diſalowing it. Come not at it. If God bee God followe hym: If the maſſe bee God, let them
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:9364:155"/>
that will ſee it, heare or be preſent at it, go to the deuil with it. What is there as God ordayned? Hys ſupper was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be receaued of vs in the memorial of his death, for the confyrmation of our fayth that his body was broken for vs &amp; his bloodſhed for pardon of oure ſynnes: but in the Maſſe there is no receauyng, but the prieſte keepeth all to hym ſelfe alone. Chriſte ſayeth, take eate: no ſayeth the Prieſte gape pepe. There is a ſacrificyng, yea killing of Chriſte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne as muche as they maye. There is Idolatry in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping the outwarde ſigne of breade and wyne: there is all in Latten, you can not tel what he ſayeth. To conclude, there is nothyng as God ordayned: Wherefore my good Mother come not at it.</p>
               <p>Oh wil ſome ſay, it wyl hynder you if you refuſe to come to maſſe and to do as other do.

For when we ſtande in a doubt whether God be our father, we cannot bee thankefull to GOD, we cannot hartelye praye or thynke any thyng we doe, acceptable to God, we cannot loue our neighboures and geue ouer our ſelues to care for them and do for them as we ſhould do, and therfore Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is moſt ſubtile hereaboutes, knowyng full well that if we doubte of Gods fatherlye eternall mercies towardes vs through Chriſt, we cannot pleaſe god, or do any thynge as we ſhould do to man. Continually caſteth he into our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories our imperfection, frailtye, falles and offences, that we ſhould doubt of gods mercye and fauour towardes vs. Therfore my good Syſter, we muſt not be ſluggiſh herein, but as Sathan laboureth to loſen our fayth, ſo muſte we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to faſten it by thynkyng on the promiſes and couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God in Chriſtes blood, namely that god is our god wyth all that euer he hathe: which couenaunt dependeth and han<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geth vpon gods owne goodnes, mercy and truth only, and not on our obedience or worthines in any poynte, for then ſhould we neuer be certayne. In dede God requyreth of vs obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; worthines, but not that therby we might be hys chyldren and he our father, but becauſe he is our father and we hys chyldren through hys own goodnes in Chriſt, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore requyreth he faythe and obedience. Nowe if we wante this obedience and worthynes which he requyreth, ſhoulde we doubt whether he be our father? Nay, that were to make our obedience and worthynes the cauſe, and ſo to put chriſt out of place, for whoſe ſake god is our father. But rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is our father and we feele our ſelues to wante ſuch things as he requireth, we ſhould be ſtyrred vp to a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtnes and bluſhyng, becauſe we are not as we ſhoulde be: and therupon ſhould we take occaſion to goe to our father in prayer on thys manner: Deare father thou of thyne own mercy in Chriſt haſt choſen me to be thy childe, and therfore
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:9364:159"/>
thou wouldeſt I ſhould be brought into thy church, &amp; fayth full company of thy chyldren, wherin thou haſt kept me he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, thy name therfore be prayſed. Now I ſee my ſelfe to wante fayth, hope, loue, &amp;c. which thy children haue &amp; thou requireſt of me, where throughe the deuyll would haue me to doubte, yea vtterlye to diſpayre of thy fatherly goodnes, fauour, and mercy. Therfore I come to thee as to my merci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full father through thy deare ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, and pray thee to helpe me good Lord, helpe me, and geue me faythe, hope, loue, &amp;c. and graunt that thy holy ſpirite may be with me for euer, and more and more to aſſure me that thou arte my father: that thys mercifull couenaunt thou madeſt with me in reſpecte of thy grace in Chriſt and for Chriſt, and not in reſpecte of any my worthines, is alwayes true to me, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>On thys ſorte (I ſay) you muſt praye and vſe your co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations when Sathan woulde haue you to doubte of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. He doth all he can to preuaile herein. Do you al you can to preuaile herein againſt him. Though you feele not as you would, yet doubt not, but hope beyonde all hope, as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham did. Fayth always (as I ſaid) goeth before feeling. As certayne as god is almighty, as certayn as god is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, as certayne as god is true, as certayne as Chriſt was crucifyed, is ryſen, and ſytteth on the ryght hand of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: as certayne as this is gods commaundement, <hi>I am the Lord thy god:</hi> ſo certayne oughte you to be that God is your father. As you are bound to haue none other gods but him, ſo are you no leſſe bounde to beleue that god is your God. What profyte ſhould it be to you to beleue thys to be true: <hi>I am the Lord thy god,</hi> to others, yf you ſhoulde not beleue that this is true to your ſelfe? The Deuil beleueth on this ſorte. And whatſoeuer it bee that woulde moue you to doubte of thys, whether god be your god through Chriſt, that ſame commeth vndoubtedlye of the Deuyll. Wherfore dyd GOD make you, but becauſe he loued you? Myghte not he haue made you blynde, dumme, deafe, lame, fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyke &amp;c? Myghte not he haue made you a Iewe, a Turke, a Papiſte &amp;c? And whye hathe he not done ſo? Verelye becauſe he loued you. And whye dydde
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:9364:160"/>
he loue you? What was there in you to moue hym to loue you? Surelye nothing moued hym to loue you, &amp; therfore to make you, and ſo hetherto to kepe you, but hys owne good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in Chriſt. Now then in that his goodnes in Chriſt ſtyll remayneth as much as it was:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccle.</hi> 2.</note> that is, euen as great as him ſelfe, for it cannot be leſſoned, how ſhould it be but that he is your god and father? Beleue this, beleue this my good Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, for god is no chaungeling: them whome he loueth, he he loueth to the ende.</p>

All theſe thynges ſpryng out of thys certayne perſwaſion and fayth that god is our father, and we are hys children by Chriſte Ieſus. All thynges ſhould helpe our fayth herein: but Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than goeth about in all thynges to hynder vs. Therfore let vs vſe earneſt and harty prayer.

of this couenant. Let vs remember all the free pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the goſpell: let vs ſet before vs gods benefites ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerallie in making this worlde, in ruling it, in gouernyng it, in calling and keping his church &amp;c.

Conſider what this life is: conſider what death is: conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what is prepared for you after death. Concerning thys life, you knowe that it is full of miſerye, vanitie and woe: it is a playne exile and hath nothing in it permanente. It is therfore compared to a vapor, to a ſmoke, to a ſhadowe, yea to a warrefare, a wildernes, a vale of wretchednes, wherein we are compafed on euery ſide with moſte fearce and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full enemyes: and ſhoulde we deſire to dwell here?

Daniells denne is not ſo dreadfull as is this dongeon we dwell in.</p>
               <p>Concerning death to them that be (as I knowe you are) Gods deare children, my tenderlye beloued ſiſter, what other thynge is it then the diſpatcher of all diſpleaſure, the ende of al trauaile, the doore of deſires, the gate of gladnes, the porte of paradyſe, the hauen of heauen, the rayle of reſte and quietnes, the entraunce to felicitie, the beginnyng of all bliſfulnes. It is the very bedde of doune (and therefore wel compared to a ſleepe) for the doulefull bodies of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to reſte in, oute of the whiche they ſhall riſe and awake moſte freſhe and luſtye to life euerlaſting. It is a paſſage to the Father, a chariot to heauen, the Lordes meſſenger, a leader vnto Chriſt, a going to oure home, a deliueraunce from bondage and priſon, a dimiſſion from warre, a ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie from all ſorrowes, and a manumiſſion from all miſerye. So that the very heathen dyd in ſome places cauſe the daye of their death to be celebrated with myrth, melody and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrelſie,

and ſhould we be diſmayde at it? Shoulde we be a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>frayde of it? Should we tremble to heare of it? Should ſuch a frend as it is, be vnwelcome? Should the foulnes of hys face feare vs from his good conditions? Should the harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his huſke hinder vs from his ſwete cornell? Shoulde the roughnes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tide tie vs to the bancke and ſhore, there to be drowned, rather then the deſire of oure home dryue vs to go aburde?

In conſideration whereof, both mindefull of my promyſe made vnto you, and careful for your ſafetye, I haue cauſed a place to be prouided for your wiues deliueraunce, where ſhe may ſo quietly and ſafely remaine, that for the auoyding of the perilles and daungers of theſe dayes. I ſee none more conueniente: I meane it in Hadley at D. Taylours houſe, where I truſt there is no peril to you ward nor to any that feareth or regardeth any perill that thereby maye happen. And herein of very loue and good wil I am the more fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and bolde to admoniſh you, not as diſtruſting you (god forbid, for I thynke of you as of a very childe of god) but as one carefull for you, leſt you ſhoulde at length throughe the common infirmitie of our fraile fleſh &amp; the manifold offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the world, do exteriourly as the world doth, to ſaue your ſleue and maime your arme for euer: as thoſe do which for the ſauing of their goods, ieoperde goodes of bodye and ſoule in the peril of eternall dampnation. If I ſuſpected any ſuch thing in you (gentle maiſter Hales) I then would goe aboute to tell you what this life is: a ſmoke, a ſhadow, a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poure &amp;c. what the glorye of thys life is: graſſe, haye: yea how full of miſery it is, and hath more allowes then honye Iob. <hi>9.</hi> If I ſuſpected any thyng your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, I wold the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſet before you on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one part y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Chriſt which ſhal be moſt aſſuredly, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> terrible ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which ar aſhamed

But as I ſayd before I ſay agayne, becauſe I am as wel perſwaded of you (my derely beloued brother) as of any in your profeſſion &amp; ſtate: I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not but pray god to make perfect y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good which he hath begun in you, and deſyre you, as you haue begon in god, ſo to go forward. As your exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple hath done good to ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny, ſo caſt not al down w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a type. Terrible is that wo which Chriſt threatneth to them by whome offences do come. You know y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the way to ſaluation is ſtraiter then men make it. You knowe the ſoule is to be conſidered aboue all thyngs. Happy is the loſſe of that bodily lyfe, liberty and goods, by the which a ſpiritual life, fredome and felicity is purchaſed. What ſhould it profit a man to winne the whole world and to loſe hys own ſoule? Who would deſire a two yeres mery lyfe for an eternall ſorrowe? as theſe maſſe goſpellers doe, which yet are vncertaine of two yeres lyfe, and god know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what woundes their conſciences haue. Hard is it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer health to the conſcience: and becauſe I am carefull for it to you wardes, as to mine own brother and dere frende, therfore I wryte thus. We are in gods power and not in the power of our enemies: he it is that hath all our heares numbred: before he ſaye Amen, no man ſhall once touche you. Into hys handes committe your ſelfe: caſt your care on hym, haue a care to pleaſe hym, &amp; then he wyll care to kepe you. You knowe the othe the <hi>Athenienſes</hi> dyd make: <hi>pugna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo pro ſacris, &amp; ſolus &amp; cum alijs. <hi>I wyll fyghte for the defence of religion both alone and with others.</hi>

If worldly men dare ieopard a iointe with god, rather then they would loſe worldlye thinges (as experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce teacheth) certeinly it ſhould be muche to our ſhame, which in Baptiſme haue vowed and ſolempnely ſworn to forſake the world, if we dare not ieoperd a iointe wyth man, rather then we woulde loſe a good conſcience and ſpirituall trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. He that will not haue gods bleſſyng, it ſhall be taken from him, ſayeth Dauyd.</p>
               <p>Therfore (my derely beloued) beware: you are now the temple of the holy ghoſt, defile it not for the lordes ſake, but kepe it pure, not only from all vncleannes of the ſpirit, but alſo of the fleſh. <hi>2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.</hi> as I truſt you wil: and crye vppon your father for his ſtrength and ayde, which I beſeche him of his mercy alwais to geue vnto you, my own good frend, euen as I deſyre to my ſelfe.

Happy are they that marke the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of god vpon other to come and encreaſe in repentance, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. to feare gods wrath and iudgements, which is alwayes lyke hymſefe, if we follow the ſteppes of them on whom he taketh puniſhment. I nede not to tell you the cauſe of thys that hath happened vnto your father, if it be as I with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row haue heard. For you know wel enough that tyl he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoke god, gaue eare to the Serpents cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel, began to mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the truth, &amp; to frame hymſelfe outwardly to doe that which his conſcience reproued inwardly (for that which he myngled with the loue of god, I meane the loue of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, cannot be in any man without the expulſion of gods loue) til then. I ſay, god did not departe and leaue him to himſelfe to the example of you and me and al others, that we ſhould feare euen our ſelues and our owne handes more then man &amp; all the powers of the world, yf we therfore ſhould do any thing which ſhould wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d our conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.

Sathan perchaunce telleth GOD (as he dydde of Iob) that ye loue GOD for youre goodes ſake.

Oh forgette not the ende that happened to Iob: for as it happened to him, ſo ſhal it happen vnto you: for god is the ſame god and can not longe forgette to ſhewe mercye to them that looke and longe for it, as I knowe ye do, and I praye you ſo to do ſtyll, for the Lorde loueth you, and neuer can nor wyll forgette to ſhewe and powre out hys mercye vppon you.

After a little whyle that he hath afflycted and tryed you (ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Peter) he will viſite, comforte, and confyrme you.

               <p>Go to therfore, diſpoſe your goods, prepare your ſelues to tryall, that eyther ye may ſtande to it like gods champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or els yf ye feele ſuche infirmitie in your ſelues that ye be not hable, geue place to violence, and go where ye maye with free and ſafe conſcience ſerue the lord.

As God tolde Ioſeph in a dreame by an aungel that he ſhoulde flye: ſo yf ye feele ſuch infirmity in your ſelues as ſhoulde turne to gods diſhonor and your owne deſtruction wythal: know that at this preſent I am as gods aungel to admoniſh you to take tyme whyles ye haue it, and to ſee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in no caſe Gods name by you myghte be diſhonoured. Ioſeph myghte haue obiected the omiſſion of his vocation, as perchaunce ye wil doe: but deare hartes, let vocations and all things els geue place to gods name &amp; the ſanctifyeng therof.

For by this you ſhal know how to take thys world, and your home here as no home, but that ye loke for an other, and ſo geue occaſion to others, leſſe to loue thys world, and perchaunce to ſome to doubte of their religion, Wherin though they be earneſt, yet would not they looſe ſo much as ye do for your religion, which ye confyrme to me &amp; others by your geuyng place to violence.</p>

This cogniſance of the Lord ſtandeth not in forket cappes tippettes, ſhauen crownes or ſuch other baggage and antichriſtian pelfe, but in ſuffering for the Lords ſake.

I know in very dede that you haue and feele your vnthankefulnes to god and other ſinnes, to witnes to you that you haue deſerued this priſonment, and lacke of libertie betwixt god &amp; your ſelf, and I would you ſo would confeſſe vnto god in your prayers, with peticion for pardon &amp; thankeſgeuing for his correcting you here. But you know y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Magiſtrates do not perſecute in you youre ſinnes, your vnthankefulnes &amp;c. but they perſecute in you Chriſt himſelfe, his righteouſnes, his veritie, and therefore happie be you that haue founde ſuch fauour with God your father as to accompt you worthy to ſuffer for his ſake in the ſight of man: ſurely you ſhal reioyce therfore one daye with a ioy vnſpeakeable in the ſight of man alſo.</p>
               <p>You may thinke your ſelf borne in a bleſſed time, that haue found this grace with God, to be a veſſel of honour to ſuffer with his Saints, yea with his ſonne. My beloued, god hath not done ſo with many. The Apoſtle ſaith not many noble,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8</note> not many riche, not many wiſe in the world hath the Lord god choſen. Oh then what cauſe haue you to reioyce, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> not many he hath choſen you to be one. For thys cauſe hath God placed you in your office, that therefore you might y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more ſee his ſpecial dignation &amp; loue towards you. It had not been ſo greate a thing for Maiſter Hopkins to haue ſuffred as Maiſter Hopkins, as it is for M. Hopkins
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:9364:187"/>
alſo to ſuffer as Maiſter Shrefe. Oh happie day y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you were made Shrefe, by the whiche, as God in this worlde woulde promote you to a more honourable degree, ſo by ſuffering in this roume he hath exalted you in heauen &amp; in the ſighte of his church &amp; children, to a much more excellent glory. When was it redde, that a Shrefe of a citie hath ſuffred for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lords ſake? Where reade we of any ſhrefe that hath bene caſt in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for conſcience to godwardes? How could god haue delt more louingly with you then herein he hath done? To the end of the world it ſhall be written for a memoriall to youre prayſe that Richard Hopkins Shrefe of Couentry for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to do his office before god, was caſt in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Flete &amp; there kept priſoner a long time. Happie, &amp; twyſe happy are you, if herefore you may geue your life. Neuer could you haue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned to this promotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on this ſort out of that office. How do you preach nowe, not onely to all men, but ſpeciallye to Mageſtrates in this realme? Who would euer haue thought that you ſhould haue bene y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt Mageſtrate y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo: Chriſtes ſake ſhould haue loſt any thing? As I ſayd before therefore I ſaye agayne, that your ſtate is happie. Good brother be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore god I write the truth vnto you, may conſcience hearing me witnes, that you are in a moſt happy ſtate with the lord and before hys ſight.</p>
               <p>Be thankefull therfore, reioyce in your trouble, praye for pacience,<note place="margin">Iacob. i.</note> perſeuer to the ende, let pacience haue her perfecte worke. If you wante this wiſedome and power, aſke it of god, who will geue it to you in his good time.

He is with you in trouble: he heareth you calling vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, yea before you cal your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires are not only knowen, but accepted through Chriſt. If now and then he hide his face from you, it is but to prouoke your appetite, to make you the more to long for him. Thys is moſt true, he is a comming and will come, he wil not bee long. But if for a time he ſeme to tary, yet ſtand you ſtil and you ſhall ſee the wonderfull workes of the Lorde. Oh my beloued, wherfore ſhould you be heuie? Is not Chriſt Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel god with vs? ſhal you not finde y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as he is true in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

Oh great comfort: who ſhall haue this? Forſoth they that ſuffer for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lord. And are not you one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Yea verely are you. Then as I ſaide, happie, happie, and happie againe are you my dearly beloued in the Lord. You nowe ſuffer w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the lord, ſurely you ſhall be glorifyed with him.

I wryte to you none otherwyſe then I am perſua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded (I thanke god) and purpoſe to go before you. I knowe there is an eternall lyfe, I hope to be pertaker of it through chriſt. I know this is the way thether, I meane by ſuffring. I know yf we ſuffer wyth hym, we ſhall raigne wyth hym. I know that by the croſſe, he maketh vs lyke to Chriſt here that we mayghte be like to hym elſewhere: therfore I wryte to you not wordes only. And hereupon I am the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt: as to admoniſh, ſo to pray you to cleaue ſtyl to the lord and hys true religion which you haue receiued, and I for my part am ſure that I haue preached vnto you. For the confirmation wherof, as I am in bondes, ſo I truſt in the

goodnes of God and his power, to geue my lyfe in and for the ſame, that you and others might be certeyne, and follow as god ſhal cal you and vouche you worthy. Remember y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> die you muſt, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as you know not, ſo where and how, it is vncertain to you.

Moreouer to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you ſhal leaue your goods it is hyd from you, for you may purpoſe, but god wyll dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Therfore if god wyll haue you to dye, or to loſe your goodes for hys cauſe, how much are you bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d then to bleſſe God? ſure you may be that you can not periſh, for of all wayes to heauen it is the moſt ſure way. Your goods God wil preſerue, ſo that your children ſhal find them, although the wyckeh ſpoyle euerye peece of them: for the rightuous mans ſeede I haue not ſene (ſaith Dauyd) beg theyr bread, but god wyll bleſſe them into a thouſande generations: the which thyng I pray god to remember towardes your chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne for his name ſake, Amen.</p>
               <p>Thus wyl I betake you to god, and to his holy word, which is able, as to teache you whych way to ſerue god, ſo to ſaue you if you beleue and loue it. If I thought it myght do you any good, I would ſend you a boke which Iames Bradſhaw already hath, to teach you how you ſhuld behaue your ſelues, eſpecially co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the Maſſe.

ſaffe to chooſe vs emonges many, to witnes and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy, that chriſt hys ſonne is Kyng and that hys word is true. Chriſt our ſauiour for hys loues ſake towards vs, wil haue vs to beare recorde that he is no vſurper nor deceyuer of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people, but Gods Embaſſadour, Prophet, and Meſſias: ſo that of al dignities vpon earthe this is the higheſt. Grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter honoure had not hys Prophetes, Apoſtles nor deareſt frendes, then to beare witnes wyth Chriſt, as we now doe. The worlde folowyng the counſell of theyr Syer Sathan, would gladly condempne Chriſt and hys verity: but loe the lord hath choſen vs to be hys champions, to lette this. As ſtoute ſouldiours therfore let vs ſtand to our maiſter, who is wyth vs and ſtandeth on our ryght hande that we ſhall not be muche moued, if we hope and hange on hys mercye: he is ſo faythful &amp; true, that he wyl neuer tempt vs further then he will make vs hable to beare. Therfore be not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full (for I heare ſay thys day you ſhall be called forth) what you ſhal anſwer. The lord which is true &amp; cannot lie, hath promyſed and wyll neuer fayle nor forget it, that you ſhall haue both what and how to aunſwer, ſo as ſhall make hys ſhameles aduerſaries aſhamed. Hange therfore on this pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>myſe of God, who is an helper at a pinch and a moſt preſent remedy to them that hope in hym. Neuer was it hearde of or ſhalbe, that any hopyng in the lord was put to foyle.</p>
               <p>Therfore as I ſaid, I ſay againe, Deare Syſter be not only not careful for your anſweryng, but alſo be ioyfull for your cauſe. Confeſſe Chriſt and be not aſhamed, and he wil confeſſe you and neuer be aſhamed of you. Thoughe loſſe of goodes and lyfe be lyke here to enſue: yet yf Chriſt be true (as he is moſt true) it is otherwyſe in dede: for he that loſeth hys life ſayth he, wynneth it, but he that ſaueth it, looſeth it. Our ſynnes haue deſerued many deathes.

Be thankeful ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore good Syſter, be thankefull, reioyce and be merye in the Lord, be ſtoute in hys cauſe and quarell, be not faynte har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but runne out your race, and ſet your captayne Chriſte before your eyes.

By reaſon wherof conſider two thynges: one the cauſe on our behalfe: the other what wil be the ſequel on ſtraungers. For the firſt, yf we be not blynd, we cannot but well ſee that our ſinnes are the cauſe of all this miſery: our ſynnes I ſaye, whiche I woulde that euerye one of vs woulde applye to our ſelues after the example of Ionas and Dauid, turnyng ouer the wallet that other mens offences myghte lye behynde and our own before. Not that I would excuſe other men, which exteriorly haue walked much more groſſely then manye of you haue done: but that I woulde prouoke you all as my ſelfe, to more harty repentaunce and prayer. Let vs more &amp; more encreaſe to know and lament our doubtyng of God, of hys preſence, power, anger, mercy &amp;c. Let vs better feele and hate our ſelfe loue, ſecuritie, negligence, vnthankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, vnbeliefe, impatience &amp;c. and then doubteles the croſſe ſhall be leſſe carefull, yea it ſhall be comfortable, and Chriſt moſt deare and pleaſaunt: death then ſhall be deſired as the diſpatcher of vs out of all miſery, and entraunce into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall felicity &amp; ioy vnſpeakable: the which is ſo much y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more longed for, by howe muche we feele in dede the Serpentes byttes wherwyth he woundeth our heeles, that is our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Adam and ſenſes. If we had I ſay, a liuely and true feelyng of his poyſon, we could not but, as reioyce ouer our Captayn that hath bruſed hys head, ſo be deſirous to follow hys example, that is to geue oure lyues wyth hym and for hym,<note place="margin">

of whom the Apoſtles do ſo much admonyſhe vs, that you may haue aſwell ſomethyng the more to ſtay you on, as alſo wherwith to anſwere the aduerſaries, becauſe you may perchaunce therin be ſomthing apoſed. To ſatiſfye this your deſire I wyll brieflye go about, and ſo, that I will by gods grace, fully ſet forth the ſame to enarme you to withſtand the aſſaultes of the papiſtes herein, if you marke well and read ouer agayne that which I now wryte.</p>
               <p>The papiſts do place in preeminence ouer the whole church the Pope, therby vnplacing Chriſt which is the heade of the church that geueth life to the whole bodye, &amp; by his ſpirite doth make liuely euery member of the ſame. This they doe without al ſcriptures. For where they bring in this ſpoken to Peter, <hi>feede my ſheepe,</hi> I wold gladly know whether this was not commaunded vnto others alſo. As for that (which perchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce they wil vrge) that he ſpake to Peter by name, if they had any learnyng, they would eaſelye perceaue howe that it was not for any ſuch cauſe as they pretend, but rather by a threfolde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement to reſtore to him the honour of an Apoſtle, which he had loſt by his threfold denyal. And how dare they interpretate thys worde, <hi>my ſhepe, my La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>,</hi> to be the vniuerſal Church of Chriſt? I trowe a man might eaſely by the like reaſon proue that Peter hymſelf had reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that which Chriſt had geuen to hym, in exhortyng hys fellowe paſtoures to feede the flocke of Chriſt. Is not thys pretye ſtuffe? Becauſe Chriſt ſayth to Peter, <hi>feede my ſheepe,</hi> therfore he ought to rule the vniuerſal and whole church of Chriſt. If Peter do truly write vnto others y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhold do the lyke, that is fede Chriſtes flocke, eyther he tranſlateth hys right &amp; authority co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to him vpon them, or els he doth participate &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate it with them. So that folyſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they goe aboute to eſtabliſhe that which hath no ground. Peter in dede was a ſhepeheard of the ſhepe, but ſuche a one as beſtowed hys labour on them ſo farre as he could ſtretch out hym ſelfe by hys miniſterye. But the papiſtes prate that he had ful power ouer all Churches: Wherin they maye ſee Paul to improue them, for els he had done vniuſtly in deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them the ſuperiour place. Howbeit, who euer yet redde that Peter dyd take any thyng vppon him ouer Churches
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:9364:212"/>
committed vnto other men? Was not he ſent of the churche, &amp; ſent as one not hauing rule ouer the reaile I grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that he was an excellent inſtrument of God, and for the excellencye of hys gyftes, when ſoeuer they meete together, place ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was commonlye geuen vnto hym. But what is thys to the purpoſe, to make hym ruler &amp; head ouer all the whole Churche becauſe he was ſo ouer a ſmall congregation?</p>
               <p>But be it ſo that Peter had as much geuen to him as they do affyrme: who yet will graunt that Peter had a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony geuen for his heires<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He hath left (ſay the papiſtes) to hys ſucceſſours, the ſelf ſame right which he receaued. Oh Lord God, then muſt hys ſucceſſour be a Sathan:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 4.</note> for he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued that title of Chriſt hym ſelfe. I woulde gladly haue the papiſtes to ſhew me one place of ſucceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mencioned in the Scriptures. I am ſure that when Paule purpoſely paynteth oute the whole adminiſtration of the Churche, he neyther maketh one head, nor anye enheritable Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macye, and yet he is altogether in commendation of v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitye. After he hath made mencion of one God the father, of one Chriſte, of one ſpirite, of one body of the Churche, of one faythe, and of one baptiſme, then he deſcribeth the meane and manner howe vnitye is to be kept: namelye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe vnto euerye paſtour is grace geuen after the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure wherewyth Chriſte hath endowed them. Where I praye you is now any title of <hi>Plenitudinis poteſtatis,</hi> of ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, of power? When he calleth home euery one vnto a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne meaſure, whye dyd he not forthwith ſay, one Pope? Which thyng he coulde not haue forgotten, if the thinge had beene as the papiſtes make it.</p>
               <p>But let vs graunt that perpetuitie of the Primacye in the Church, was eſtablyſhed in Peter: I woulde gladlye learne why the Seate of the Primacye ſhoulde bee rather at Rome, then elſwhere. Marye ſaye they, becauſe Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters chaire was at Rome. Thys is euen lyke to thys, that becauſe Moſes the greateſt Prophette, And Aaron the fyrſte Prieſte exerciſed theyr offyces vnto theyr deathe in the deſerte, therefore the principalleſt place of the Iewyſhe Churche ſhoulde bee in the wylderneſſe.
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:9364:213"/>
But graunt them theyr reaſon, that it is good. What ſhould Antioche clayme? For Peters chaire was there alſo: wherin Paule gaue him a checke, which was vnſemely and vnma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerlye done of Paule, that would not geue place to hys pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident &amp; better. No ſaie the papiſtes, Rome muſte haue this authoritie becauſe Peter died there. But what and if a man ſhould by probable coniectures ſhewe, that it is but a fable, which is fayned of Peters Biſhoprike at Rome? Read how Paule doth ſalute very many priuate perſons when he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to the Romaines. Three yeres after hys Epiſtle made, he was brought to Rome priſoner. Luke telleth, that he was receaued of the brethren, and yet in al theſe, no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all of Peter, whiche then by their Storyes was at Rome. Belike he was proude, as the Pope and Prelates be, or elles he woulde haue viſited Paule. Paule beinge in pryſon in Rome, dyd wryte diuerſe Epiſtles, in whiche he expreſſeth the names of manye whiche were in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of Peter but raſcall perſonages, but of Peter he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth neuer a woorde. Surelye if Peter had beene there, thys ſilence of hym had beene ſuſpicious. In the ſecond E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to Timothye,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Timo.</hi> 4.</note> Paule complayneth that no man was with hym in his defence, but all had left hym. If Peter had beene then at Rome, as they write, then eyther Paule had belyed hym, or Peter had played hys Peters parte. <hi>Luke. <hi>23.</hi>
                  </hi> In an other place, howe doth he blame all that were with hym,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phi.</hi> 2.</note> only Timothy excepted? Therfore we may well doubte whether Peter was at Rome Byſhoppe as they prate: for all thys tyme and longe before, they ſaye that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was Byſhoppe there. But I will not ſtyrre vppe coles in thys matter. If Rome bee the chiefe Seate becauſe Peter dyed there, whye ſhoulde not Antioche bee the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond? Why ſhoulde not Iames and Iohn whiche were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with Peter to bee as pillers, Whye (I ſaye) ſhoulde not theyr Seates haue honour next to Peters Seate? Is not thys geare prepoſtorous, that Alexandria where Marke which was but one of the Diſciples, was Byſhop, ſhould be preferred before Epheſus where Iohn the Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt taught and was biſhop, and before Ieruſalem where not only Iames taught and dyed biſhop, but alſo Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſus

our lord and high prieſt for euer? By whom beyng Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter (I hope) honour ſhold be geuen to his chaire, more then to the chayre of hys chaplaines. I neede to ſpeake nothing how that Paule telleth Peters Apoſtleſhip to concerne ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther circumciſion or the Iewes, and therfore properly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyneth not to vs. Neyther do I nede to bryng in Gregori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us the ſixt biſhop of Rome, which was about the yere of our Lord <hi>.600.</hi> Who plainly in his workes doth write, that this title of Primacy, &amp; to be head ouer al churches vnder Chriſt, is a title mete and agreeing only to Antichriſt, and therfore he calleth it a prophane, a myſchieuous, and an horrible ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. Who ſhould we beleue now, yf we wyll neyther beleue Apoſtle nor Pope?</p>
               <p>If I ſhould go about to tell how this name was firſt gotten by Phocas, I ſhould be to long. I purpoſe god wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng to ſet it forth at large in a worke whiche I haue begun of Antichriſt, yf god for hys mercies ſake geue me lyfe to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe it. For thys preſent therfore I ſhall deſyre your Ladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to take thys in good part. If they will nedes haue the Biſhop of Rome to bee acknowledged for the heade of the church, then wyll I vrge them that they ſhall geue vs a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop. But they obtrude vnto vs a butcher rather, or a bite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhepe, then a biſhop. They bragge of Peters ſucceſſion, of Chriſtes Vycar, this is alwayes in theyr mouth. But alas, how can we call hym Chriſtes Vicar that reſiſteth Chriſte, oppugneth hys veritye, perſecuteth hys people, and lyke a Prelate preferreth hymſelfe aboue God and man? Howe, or wherin dothe the Pope and Chriſt agree? Howe ſupplyeth he Peters miniſtery that boaſteth of hys ſucceſſion? Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to beginne withal, which I wyl vſe preſently for a con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cluſion, yf the papiſtes wyll haue the biſhop of Rome Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme head of the church of Chriſt in earthe, they muſt afore they attaine this, geue vs a biſhop in dede and not in name.

Eyghtlye becauſe the ende and purpoſe why we goe thether, is for the auoyding of the croſſe, that is; for oure owne cauſe and not for Chriſtes cauſe or for oure brethrens commoditye. For in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they make it ſo neceſſarye a thyng and a worſhipping of God, it can not but be agaynſte Chriſte and the freedome of hys Goſpell: and the ſame thing teacheth vs that it is agaynſte the commoditie of oure brethren, whiche eyther be weake, eyther be ſtronge, eyther be ignoraunt, either be obſtinate. If they be weake, by your reſorting to it they bee made more weake. If they bee ſtrong, you do what you can to infyrme their ſtrengthe, if they bee ignoraunte, therein you helpe to keepe them by your facte. If they be obſtinate, your reſortyng to it, can not but rocke them a ſlepe in their obſtinate error of the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye of this rite and ceremonie. Theſe cauſes recited do ſhew you what I thinke in thys: but my thinking muſte no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther binde you then a mannes thought ſhould do, except the ſame be grounded vpon gods word which bindeth in dede, as I thinke they do. I dout not but you waying theſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and eſpeciallye .ii. of the fyrſte and the laſte, if you pray to

God for hys ſpirite to directe you, and thereto aſke the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of thys my good brother and other godly learned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I doubte not (I ſay) but you ſhoulde bee guided to doe that whiche is beſte in Gods ſyght, althoughe in the ſyghte of the world, perhappes you ſhoulde bee counted folyſhe and precyſe. But be at a point with your ſelues, as the Diſciples of Chriſt whiche had forſaken themſelues, to followe, not your wyll but Gods will, as you daylye praye in the Lords prayer. The croſſe of Chriſt, be willyng to carye, leaſte you carye the croſſe of the worlde, the fleſhe, or the deuill. One of theſe .iiii. croſſes you muſte cary. Three of them bryngeth to hell,<note place="margin">why the more part goe that way that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</note> and therfore the more parte goeth that way, whiche is a broade way. Only the fourth bryngeth to heauen, but fewe goe that waye, aſwell becauſe the waye is ſtrayte, as alſo becauſe fewe walke in it. Howbeit, thoughe it be ſtraite it is but ſhorte, and the fewe are manye if you conſider the godly, as the Patriarkes, Prophettes, Apoſtles, Martyrs, Confeſſours, and Chriſt Ieſus, with all hys Gard &amp; traine. Thinke not ſcorne to come after them which are gone before you, and after them whiche nowe goe before you, in whoſe number I truſt I am appoynted to bee one, and I beſeche you pray for me that god woulde vouche me worthye that honour. Our ſinnes deſerue plagues, priſon, and the loſſe of al that euer we haue: therfore if god remoue our ſinnes out of ſyght, and ſend vs priſon, or loſſe of goods and liuing for his names ſake, Oh how happye are we? My deare hartes in the Lorde, conſider this geare, and be aſſured y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he whiche loſeth any thyng for Chriſtes ſake, the ſame in his poſteritie ſhal finde it here, and in heauen elſwhere.

Fayth ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth not in diſputing. I thinke fewe, if it came to diſputing, could defend the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of Chriſt, and many other articles: I ſpeake it for the ſimple ſort. Pray for me. Lacke of paper maketh thys ende. Commend me to my good brother Richard Bleacher, and my good ſiſter his wyfe: I pray them to pray for me. I truſt by this bearer to heare how you doe.</p>

               <p>As it is much to my comfort that God hath geuen you ſuch a loue and zeale to hys truth: ſo I exhort you (my good Syſter) dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to labour, as by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual readyng and meditation of gods holy word, ſo by earneſt prayer and other godly exerciſes, to maintayne and encreaſe the ſame: that by the feelyng of gods gratious ſpirite workyng in you ſuche good fruites as wytneſſes of your fayth, you may growe in ſtrength therof, and certayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of gods fauour and good wyl towardes you. For aboue all thyngs, of thys I woulde haue you to be moſte aſſured, that you are beloued of god: that you are hys dere chylde, and ſhall bee for euermore throughe Chriſte, in whome you are by fayth, and he in you. Out of thys certeintie (the cauſe wherof is gods owne goodnes, grace, and truth) ſpryngeth true loue, and louyng feare, and obedience to god continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and in all thynges. Where it is (I meane thys fayth, certaintie and perſuaſion of gods eternall goodnes to you in Chriſte) there no ſynnes are imputed to you, or layd to your charge to conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation nor ſhalbe: though for correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſake, now &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your heauenly father viſit them fatherly, or rather you for them. Where it is not, there is nothyng be it neuer ſo well done, that pleaſeth God. Labour therfore for this certainty of faith, through Chriſt. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſoeuer you dout, you heape ſinne vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſinne. If Satan, your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or gods law do accuſe you, confeſſe your fault, &amp; hide it not before the lord. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they woulde inferre y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> becauſe of your ſynne you are condemned, you are caſt away: then aunſwer them that it is but their office to accuſe and witnes, not to geue ſentence &amp; iudge: it onely apperteyneth to god to geue iudge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment. Paule ſayth, it is god that abſolueth, who then ſhall condemne vs? God hymſelfe promiſeth, before he demaund

any thyng of vs, that he is our Lord and our god: and are not they happy which haue the lord for their god? Is he god to any whoſe ſinnes he remitteth not? Through Chriſt he is our father, and therfore we are commaunded ſo to call him: and can there want any fatherly kyndnes in hym towardes vs, which be hys children? No verely. Therfore be ſure, and wauer not of gods loue &amp; fauour towardes you in Chriſt. The cauſe of hys loue is his owne goodnes and mercy: this laſting for euer, hys loue loſeth for euer. How can you then but be quiete &amp; happy? Vſe this geare to comforte the weake conſcience, and not to vnbridle the mighty affections of the fleſhe or olde Adam, which muſt haue other meate.</p>

Nowe will I for the more encouraginge you to the croſſe, geue you a further <hi>memorandum:</hi> namelye of the commodities and profites which come by the trouble &amp; afflictions now riſen and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe to vs which be gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> elect through Ieſus Chriſt.

               <p>Fyrſt, in that there is no croſſe which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth vpon any of vs without the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel of our heauenly father (for as for the fanſie of fortune, it is wicked,<note place="margin">

               <p>Secondly the ende wherfore God declareth hys iuſtice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our ſynne original and actual, &amp; woulde by hys croſſe haue vs to conſider the ſame and to cal to minde our former euill deedes: the end hereof (I ſaye) is thys, that we myghte lament, be ſory, ſygh and pray for pardon, that ſo doing we

myghte obtayne the ſame by the meanes of fayth in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of Ieſus Chriſt hys deare Sonne: and further that we being humbled becauſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euill that dwelleth in vs, might become thankefull for Gods goodnes and loue in continual watchyng and warynes to ſuppreſſe the euill which lyeth in vs,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iacob.</hi> 1.</note> that it bring not forth fruites to death at any time. This ſecond commoditie of the croſſe therfore, muſt we not count to be a ſimple knowledge onlye, but a great gayne of Gods mercy, with wonderful riche and precious vertues of fayth, repentaunce, remiſſion of ſinnes, humilitie, thankefulneſſe, mortification, and diligence in doing good. Not that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the croſſe worketh theſe thinges of it ſelfe, but becauſe the croſſe is the meane and way by the which God worketh the knowledge and felyng of theſe thynges in his children: as many, both teſtimonyes and examples in Scriptures are eaſely found of them, that diligentlye waye what there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they read.</p>
               <p>To theſe too commodities of the croſſe, ioyne the thyrd of Gods ſinguler wiſedome, that it may be coupled with hys iuſtice and mercye. On thys ſorte therfore let vs conceaue when we ſee the Goſpell of God and hys Churche perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and troubled, as now with vs it is, that becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greate learned and wiſe men of the worlde vſe not their wiſedome to loue and ferue God, as to naturall wiſedome and reaſon he openeth hym ſelfe manifeſtlye by hys viſible creatures:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.</note> therefore doth God iuſtlye infatuate and make them folyſh, geuyng them vppe to vnſenſiblenes, eſpecially herein. For on thys maner reaſon they concerning the affliction whiche commeth for the Goſpell: If (ſaye they) thys were Gods woorde, if theſe people were Gods children, ſurelye God woulde then bleſſe and proſper them &amp; their doctrine. But nowe in that there is no doctrine ſo much hated, no people ſo muche perſecuted as they bee: therefore it can not bee of GOD. Rather this is of God whiche our Queene &amp; olde Byſhops haue profeſſed. For how hath God preſerued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and kept them? what a notable victorye hath GOD geuen vnto her, where it was impoſſible that thynges ſhoulde ſo haue come to paſſe as they haue done? And dyd not the greate Captayne confeſſe hys faulte that he was oute of the way, and not of the fayth which theſe goſpellers profeſſe?
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:9364:229"/>
How many are come agayne, from that which they profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be gods word? The moſt part of thys realme (notwith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtanding the diligence of preachers to perſuade them concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this new learnyng, which nowe is perſecuted) neuer conſented to it in harte, as experience teacheth. And what plagues haue come vpon this realme ſythen this goſpel (as they cal it) came in amongeſt vs? Afore, we had plentye but now there is nothing like as it was. Moreouer al the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Parliamente haue ouerthrowne the lawes made for the ſtabliſhyng of thys goſpell and religion, and newe lawes are erected for the continuance of the contrary. How miraculouſly dothe God confounde their doctrine and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyrme oures? For how was wyat ouerthrowne? How pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſperouſly came in our Kyng? Howe hathe God bleſſed our Quene wyth fruite of wombe? How is the Popes holines reſtored agayne to hys ryght? All theſe do teache plainelye that thys their doctrine is not gods word. Thus reaſon the worldly wyſe whiche ſee not gods wiſdome. For els yf they conſidered that there was wyth vs vnthankefulnes for the goſpell, no amendment of lyfe, but all kynde of contempt of God, all kynde of ſhameles ſinnyng enſued the preachyng of the Goſpel: they muſt nedes ſee that God coulde not but chaſtice and correct: and as he let Sathan looſe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20.</note> after he had bounde hym a certaine time, for vnthankefulnes of men: ſo to let theſe Champions of Sathan runne abroade, by them to plague vs for oure vnthankefulnes. Greate was gods anger againſt Achab becauſe he ſaued Benadad kyng of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, after he had geuen hym into his handes,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Reg.</hi> 20.</note> and afterwarde it turned to hys owne deſtruction. God would that double ſorrow ſhould haue bene repayde to them by cauſe of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe they dyd to the ſayntes of God.

               <p>As for the victory geuen to the Quenes hyghnes, if men had any godly witte, they myght ſee many thyngs in it. Firſt god hath done it to wynne her harte to the Goſpel. Agayne, he hathe done it, aſwel becauſe they that wente a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt her, put their truſt in horſes and power of men, and not in God, as becauſe in their doyng they ſoughte not the propagation of gods goſpell: which thyng is now plainlye ſene. Therfore no maruayle why god fought againſt them: would
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:9364:230"/>
they were hypocrites, and vnder the cloke of the Goſpel, would haue debarred the Quenes highnes of her right, but god would not ſo cloke them.</p>
               <p>Now for the relentyng, returning, &amp; recantyng of ſome from that whiche they once profeſſed or preached: alas, who would wonder at it? for they neuer came to the goſpell but for commodity &amp; gaines ſake, and now for gaine they leaue it. The multitude is no good argument to moue a wiſe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For who knoweth not moe to loue this world, better then heauen: themſelues better then their neighbours. Wyde is the gate (ſaith Chriſt) and broade is the way that leadeth to deſtruction,<note place="margin">

               <p>But I will now returne to the thirde commoditye commyng by the croſſe. Here let vs ſee the wiſdom of God in making the wiſdom of the world foliſh, which knoweth little of mans corruption how foule it is in the ſight of god, and diſpleaſeth hym: whiche knoweth little the porcion of gods people to be in an other world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whyche knoweth li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the patrone of Chriſtians Chriſt Ieſus: whych know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth lyttle the generall iudgemente of GOD: the greate malyce of Sathan to Gods people:<note place="margin">

them which ſynne leaſt, would haue hys anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſynne ſene moſt and to be better conſidered &amp; feared. In puniſhyng hys people here he kyndleth their deſyre towardes their reſtfull home. In puniſhing his ſeruauntes in this lyfe, he dothe conforme and make them lyke to Chriſt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phi.</hi> 1.</note> that as they be lyke in ſufferyng, ſo ſhall they bee in reigning. In puniſhyng hys churche in the world, he doth geue a demonſtration of hys iudgement whiche ſhall come on all men, when the godly ſhal there fynd reſt, though now they be afflicted: and the wicked now wallowing in welth ſhalbe wrapped in woe and ſmarte. In puniſhyng the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profeſſers of his goſpel in earth, he ſetteth forth the malyce of Sathan agaynſt the goſpell and hys people,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts.</hi> 16</note> for the more confyrmyng of theyr fayth &amp; the goſpell to be gods worde in dede, and they be gods people: for els the Deuill woulde let them alone. In puniſhyng the louers of hys truth more then others which care not for it, he putteth them in mynde how they haue not had in price as they ſhould haue had, the iuell of hys worde and goſpel.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 119</note> Before ſuch trial and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence came, perchaunce they thought they had beleued &amp; had had fayth, which now they ſee was but a lyp fayth, a mocke faith, or an opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Al which thyngs we ſee are occaſions for vs to take better hede, by meane of the croſſe. Therfore third lye lette vs conſider the croſſe to be commodious for vs, to learne gods wiſdome, and what is mans foliſhnes: gods diſpleaſure at ſinne: a deſire to be wyth god: the conformitie wyth Chriſt: the general iudgement: the malice of Sathan: hatred of ſynne: the goſpell to be gods word, and how it is to be eſtemed, &amp;c. Thus much for thys.</p>
               <p>Now will I fourthly briefly ſhew you, the croſſe or trouble to be profitable for vs to learne and behold better, the prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, preſence, and power of god, that all theſe may be coupled together as in a chaine to hang about our necks: I meane gods iuſtice, mercye, wiſedome power, preſence, and prouidence. When all thinges be in reſt, and men be not in trouble, then they are forgetful of god commonly, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to much to their owne wiſdome, polices, prouidence diligence, as though they were the procurers of their owne fortune and workers of their owne weale. But when the

For the Scripture teacheth al things to come from God, weale, and woe:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Amos.</hi> 3</note> and that the ſame ſhoulde be loked vpon as gods worke, although Sathan the Deuil be often an inſtrument by whome god worketh iuſtlye and mercifully. Iuſtly to the wycked, &amp; mercifully to the godly:<note place="margin">

The childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of god therfore, which before forgatte god in proſperitie, now in aduerſitie are awaked to ſee God in hys worke, and no more to hang on their owne forecaſtes, power, frendes, wiſdom, riches, &amp;c: but learne to caſt them ſelues on gods prouidence and power, whereby they are ſo preſerued and gouerned, and verye often miraculouſlye deliuered, that the verye wycked cannot but ſee gods prouidence, preſence, and power in the croſſe and affliction of hys children, as they (his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I meane) to their ioy do feele it,<note place="margin">

Which of them dyd not ſuffer, at the leaſt, impriſonmente or bannyſhment for hys Goſpell and woorde? Nowe Mother, how farre am I vnmeete to bee compared to them?

God myghte haue cauſed me long before thys tyme to haue beene caſte into pryſon as a theefe, a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer, an vncleane liuer, and an heynous offender of the lawes of the Realme, but deare Mother, hys mercye is ſo greate vppon both you and me and all that loue me, that I ſhoulde bee caſte into pryſon as none of theſe, or for anye ſuche vices: but onelye for hys Chriſtes ſake, for hys Goſpelles ſake, for hys Churches ſake: that hereby, as I myghte learne to lamente and bewayle my ingratitude and ſynnes: ſo I myghte reioyce in hys mercye, bee thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, looke for eternall ioye wyth Chriſte, for whoſe ſake (prayſed bee hys name for it) I nowe ſuffer, and therfore ſhoulde be merye and gladde.

That litle piece of worke I commend vnto you, as a thing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I doute not to anſwer to my comfort before the trubual ſeat of Ieſus Chriſt: and therfore I hartely pray you and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery of you, for the tender mercies of God in Chriſte, that you woulde not be raſhe to condemne thinges vnknowen, leſt gods woe ſhould fall vpon you for callyng good euyll and euyll good. For the greate loue of god in Chriſte, cauil not at things that be wel ſpoken, nor conſtrue not things to the euil part, when ye haue occaſion otherwiſe. Do not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that any man, by affirmyng predeſtination (as in that boke I haue truly ſet it forth accordyng to gods worde, and the conſent of chriſtes church) either to ſeke carnalitie, or to ſet forth matter of deſperation. Only by the doctrine of it, I haue taught, as to my ſelfe, ſo to others, a certaintie of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: a ſetting vp of Chriſt only: an exaltatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of gods grace, mercye, righteouſnes, truth, wiſdom, power and glory, and a caſting downe of man and al hys power, that he that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth may glory onelye and altogether, and continuallye in the Lorde.</p>

doubt, and ſo to diſpayre, and hatred of god: but god for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy hereof, hath ordeined hys word: which is deuided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ij. partes: the one is a doctrine which demaundeth of vs our duety, but geueth no power thereto, the other is a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine which not ſo much demaundeth as geueth. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is called the law, which hath hys promiſes, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditionals and comminations, or threates accordinglye. The other is called the goſpel, or rather the free promiſes hanging not on conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s on our behalfe, but ſimply on gods verity &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, although they requyre conditions, but not as hangyng theron: of which promyſes the goſpell may well be called a puplication. The former, that is, the law wyth her promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and comminations, tell man what he is, and ſhew hym what he can do. The later, that is the goſpell and free promi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes, tell and ſet forth Chriſt, and what mercy at Gods hand throughe Chriſt, we haue offred and geuen vnto vs. The former parte ſerueth to keepe the olde man from carnalitie and ſecurity, and to ſtirre hym vp to diligence and ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. The later parte ſerueth howe to kepe the newe and inwarde man from doubtyng and diſpayre, &amp; to bryng vs in to an aſſured certayntye and quietenes wyth God, through Chryſte. The olde man and the fielde he reſteth in, maye not be ſowen with any other ſeede then is agreable to the former doctrine. The newe man and the fielde he reſteth in, maye not be ſowen wyth anye other, then is agreeynge to the later doctryne. By thys meanes man ſhall be kepte from carnalitie, and from deſperation alſo, and broughte into diligence and godlye peace of conſcience.

As for example, when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophets do foreſhowe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ouerthrowes of realmes &amp; peoples, how do they ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the whole ſhape of the worlde ſhal be moued therat? Loke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Eſay, how he, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecieth the fall of Babilon, doth ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſtarres ſhall not ſhyne from heauen: the ſunne ſhal be darkened in his riſing:
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:9364:250"/>
the mone ſhall not geue her light. And afterwards he ſaith: I wil ſhake y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heauens &amp; the earth ſhall be moued out of his place. <hi>Eſay. <hi>13.</hi>
                  </hi> But the hiſtoryes do witneſſe that there are wonderful chaunges of al creatures both heauenly &amp; earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ouerthrowes and deſtructions of realmes &amp; people.</p>
               <p>Agayne, when Eſay doth Prophecye of the kingdome of Chriſt, he doth promyſe new heauens &amp; new earth, and that ſo excellent and new, that he ſheweth the former heauens &amp; earth to be vtterly forgotten. <hi>Eſay. <hi>63.</hi>
                  </hi> Wherto the Apoſtle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth, making Chriſt the repairer of al things in heauen &amp; in earth. <hi>Epheſi. <hi>1.</hi> Col. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </hi> Howe dyd both heauen and earth geue their ſeruice to the Iſraelites co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming forth of Egipte, aſwel in preſeruing them, as in deſtroying their enemyes: How did the ſunne ſhyne longer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was wont to do, for Ioſue to ouercome hys enemies? How did eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels fyght for Ezechias againſt the Aſſirians? Read the <hi>.30.</hi> chap. of Eſay. And behold the hiſtory of Chriſt: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider how the Angels reioyced: how the ſtarre brought the wiſe men to Chriſte: howe the Aungells were miniſters vnto him in the wilderneſſe: howe the deuilles confeſſed hym. In his death, how dyd all the whole world ſhew compaſſion? The ſunne was darkened: the earth dyd quake: the rockes claue a ſunder: the vaile of the temple rent a ſunder. When he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, both heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (for the Angels w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly brightneſſe appeared) and earth which was moued, dyd reioyce: the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels were preachers of it. In hys aſcenſion alſo: dyd not a bryghte cloude receaue him and take hym vp? Dyd not the Angels teſtifye of hys returne? When he ſent the holy ghoſte and made his new couenaunte of grace, dyd not all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole worlde ſerue thereto by thunder, ſmoke, fyer, earthquake? Now, how wonderfully they will do their ſeruice to Chriſt, comming to iudgement, it is more plaine then I nede to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe. And in aſmuch as we are the members of Chriſte, he being our head, we may ſone ſee how that all thyngs haue a certayne compaſſion with man, &amp; do after their kinde, as the Apoſtle writeth, loke for a deliuerance from vanitye, which they ſhal obteyne in their reſtauration. I therfore tolde you how y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I do take y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtle to meane by euery creature ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al the whole ſhape &amp; creatures in the world. He doth attribute vnto them, how that they looke for the perfection
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:9364:250"/>
of our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: how that they are ſubiecte to vanitie: howe that they are ſubiecte in hope: how y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they grone and trauel, attributing theſe things vnto the ſenſeles creature, by tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from man, to ſignifye the ſocietie, cognation, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, which all &amp; euery creature hath with man: that as eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry &amp; all thinges were made for man: ſo by the man Chriſt, al and euery thing both earthly and heauenly ſhal be reſtored.</p>
               <p>Theſe thinges you know in effecte I ſpake vnto you, to ſtirre vp both my ſelf and you to a deper conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our bleſſed ſtate, which now we enioy in hope, which wil neuer deceaue vs: the more to occaſion vs to deſire the ful fruition of the ſame. But I do reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you were ſomething trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with ſome doutfulnes hereabout. Therfore I purpoſe now to write of thys matter more at large, therby to occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs both to ſee better, through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> helpe of gods ſpirit, that which we deſire, &amp; I pray God graunt vnto vs both for his mercies ſake: I meane the felicitie of his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie ſtate which one day in very deede (my dere hart) we ſhal fully poſſeſſe, and both together prayſe the Lord with al hys Saintes, world without end, Amen, Amen.</p>
               <p>Thys was your doubt: If ſo be that .S. Paul dyd meane by all creatures ſimply (as I haue ſpoken) that they ſhal be deliuered from corruption into ſuche a ſtate as ſhall adorne the fredome of Gods children: whether that plantes, beaſts and other thinges hauing life, ſhal bee reſtored. If yea: then you would know whether al thinges that haue bene, ſhal be reſtored alſo. And after thys you wil perchaunce aſke in what place they ſhall be: what they ſhall do, and ſo forth. As I thinke vpon this matter, and as I am accuſtomed to anſwere ſuch queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to me, I wil here write for an anſwere vnto you alſo: not douting but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> therwith you wil be ſatiſfyed, becauſe I know your hart is ſatiſfyed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> godlye &amp; ſufficient anſweres. Thus I thinke: All &amp; euery creature groneth &amp; traueleth as yet, hoping &amp; loking for my reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: for they be ſubiect to corruption for my ſynnes ſake: but they al ſhal be deliuered by my Chriſt, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bondage of corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſhal reſtore vs his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers. Thys wil I muſe on, &amp; way with my ſelf, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I may dulye knowe, both in me and in al other things, the atrocitie and bitterneſſe of
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:9364:251"/>
ſynne whieh dwelleth in me, &amp; ſo may the more hartely geue ouer my ſelf wholy to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lord Chriſt my Sauiour, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he may, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what croſſe ſoeuer ſhal pleaſe him, ſley ſynne in me, and bring me after his own wil &amp; way, to newneſſe of life. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, that I for my part, may faythfully &amp; withal my whole hart, do my diligence in mortifying the deſires of my fleſh, &amp; in labouring to obey the deſires of the ſpirite, to liue a life ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him, I beſech him of his grace. And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I maye do this cherefully, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue in thys purpoſe &amp; diligence, I wil faſten my minde, as much as the Lord ſhal enable me, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this my ſo great happineſſe wherunto I ſhal be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the reſurrection: the which reſurrection doutles ſhall be adourned by the whole ſhape of the world deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Theſe thinges wil I thinke on, theſe things wil I pauſe on: herein wil I, as it were, drowne my ſelf, being careles of thys: I meane, what partes of the world y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lorde Chriſt wil reſtore w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> me, or how he wil do it, or what ſtate or condition he wil geue it. It is enough &amp; enough for me, that I and all the whole world with me, ſhal be much more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now I can by any meanes conceaue. By reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I will prayſe and glorifye my Lorde, and by hys grace I wil ſtudy to pleaſe hym with al my hart, with all my ſoule, with all my ſtrengthe, ſinging vnto him, that he both doth wel and hath done and made al thinges wel: to hym be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal glory for euer.

               <p>If you would knowe the reaſon that moueth me to aunſweare as I haue done to the foreſayde doubtes or queſtions, it is thys. You ſee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Apoſtle in thys place to the Romaines, ſpeaketh of the deliueraunce of euerye crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the bondage of corruption, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the glorye of Gods children. Thys is ſo manifeſt, that no man can well denye it. It is but a ſimple ſhyfte to ſaye that the Apoſtle doth meane in thys place by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerye creature, man onelye. He is not wonte to ſpeake
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:9364:251"/>
on that fort. Neyther dare I ſaye that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh here hyperbotically or exceſſiuely: although ſome thinke ſo. But as I ſayd, I ſay agayn, that the Apoſtle doth here ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply affirme, that there ſhall be a renouacion &amp; a deliuerance from corruption, not only of man, but alſo of al and of euery part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole world: of euery part (I ſay) meaning partes in deede, &amp; not ſuch as be rather vices &amp; added for plagues, then for partes. For by reaſon of ſinne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> many ſpottes &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions are come into the world, as is all that is hurtfull and filthy in the creatures. Alſo, al that commeth of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as perchaunce flees, vermyne, and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>Thys renouation of all things, the Prophets do ſeme to promyſe, when they promiſe new heauens &amp; new earth: For a newe earth ſeemeth to require no leſſe renouation of earthly thinges, then new heauens do of heauenly thyngs. But theſe things the Apoſtle doth playnely affirme y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chriſt will reſtore, euen whatſoeuer be in heauen &amp; in earth. <hi>Col. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </hi> Therfore me thinkes it is the dutye of a Godly minde, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to acknowledge, and therof to bragge in the Lord, that in our reſurrection al things ſhal be ſo repayred to eternitie, as for our ſinne they were made ſubiecte to corruption.</p>
               <p>The auncient writers our of Peter, haue, as it were,<note place="margin">2. <hi>pet.</hi> 3</note> agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this ſentence, that the ſhape of this world ſhall paſſe a way through the burning of earthly fire, as it was drowned wyth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flowing of earthly waters.<note place="margin">Auguſt. de ciuitate dei lib. cap. <hi>6</hi>
                  </note> Theſe be S. Auguſtines wordes. Wherto I will adde theſe which he there writeth: the qualities (ſayth he) of the corruptible elementes which agreed with our corruptible bodyes, ſhal vtterly be burned with that ſame worldlye conflagration and burning, as I ſayd: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſubſtance it ſelf, ſhall haue thoſe qualities, which do agree by a meruelous chaunge, to oure bodyes, that the world chaunging into the better, may openly be made mete to man returned euen in the fleſh into the better. Theſe be hys words. Wherby it is plaine, that this good man did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> elements ſhould be renewed: but of other things he medleth not, except it be of the ſea, by the occaſion of that which is in the Apocalips: howbeit, ſo he ſpeaketh that he can not wel tel whether it alſo ſhal be chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged into the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, adding theſe wordes: but we read y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there ſhalbe a new
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:9364:252"/>
heauen and a newe earth. For he dyd vnderſtand the place of Eſay concerning the new heauen and new earth, ſimply: of other things he expreſſeth nothing.</p>
               <p>But Thomas Aquinas entreateth thys queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly or rather curiouſlye, affyrming the celeſtial bodies, the elementes &amp; mankinde to be renewed: but in no wiſe beaſts plantes &amp;c. to bee ſo: and this is hys principall reaſon. The renouation of the world ſhal be for man: therfore ſuch ſhall be the renouation as ſhal be conformable to the renouation of man. But the renouation, of man ſhal be from corruption to incorruption: fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mouing to reſt: the things therfore that ſhall be renewed with man, muſt be broughte alſo to incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. Now, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> celeſtial bodies &amp; the elementes were made to incorruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the one wholy &amp; in euery part, the other, that is the elementes, though in part they are corruptible, yet co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole, they are incorruptible, as man is incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning part, that is the ſoule. But beaſts, pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes &amp;c. are corruptible both wholy &amp; in euery part: therefore they were not made to incorruption, and ſo are they not confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the renewing, that is, they are not receaueable of incorruption, and therfore they ſhall not be reſtored.</p>
               <p>This reaſon is true in this part, that it affirmeth thyngs ſhal be reſtored with man, and w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him ſhal be brought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuitie, &amp; as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtle ſayth, to be deliuered from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bondage of corruption. Agayne, hys reaſon is true herein alſo, that mans reaſon may ſoner be perſuaded y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things now partly incorruptible, ſhal be reſtored altogether to incorruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But now to ſay that by no reaſon thoſe things may be broughte to perpetuitie, which now both wholy &amp; partly be te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall and momentane, howe can he proue it? in that the nature &amp; being of all thyngs, dependeth on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> omnipotencie of God, which after hys own pleaſure doth geue to things which he hath made, their being, and al is one to him, to make a thing temporall and to make it eternall. For he made all thynges of nothing: and therefore heauen and the celeſtiall bodyes haue no more of them ſelues that they be perpetuall, then haue thoſe thinges that laſte but a daye. Wherfore, thys rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which Thomas maketh, is not fyrme, in that it wholye leaueth to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which now ſeemeth and appeareth in thynges. In deede (as I ſaid) it hath ſome ſhewe or probabilitie, that
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:9364:252"/>
theſe things ſhal be renewed to eternitie for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glory of gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which now ſomthyng are pertakers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame. But now, ſeing that both it which they nowe haue, and alſo ſhall haue, dependeth vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> becke &amp; pleaſure of God, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath God made of counſell with hym concerning the renouation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world &amp; of al things, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he can tel what partes of things &amp; what kindes of things he wil renewe? Yea euen Ariſtotle dyd acknowledge that <hi>Phyſice</hi> or natural knowlege, becauſe it bringeth his reaſons fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſpoſition &amp; nature of things, hath not ful neceſſitie of his reaſons. For nature is nothing els the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ordinarie &amp; wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted wil of god, as a miracle, porte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or monſter, is the rare &amp; vnwonted wil of God. We ſay that the nature of ſtones &amp; al heuie things, is to ſinke dounward: which is nothing elles but the pleaſure of God ſo depelling them and puttinge them downe, for elles of them ſelues nothyng is eyther heuye or lyghte: all is a like to be caryed downewardes or vpwardes. Who may make God ſubiecte to hys worke? Can not he that made all things of nothyng, geue hereafter to the thinges that he hath made, that wherof nowe in them ſelues they haue no capacitie?</p>
               <p>Theſe thyngs I do therfore rehearſe, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end I myghte declare, that when we diſpute what god wyl do concernyng hys workes, how that it is not ſeemely for vs to conclude according to that which ſemeth &amp; appeareth to vs in things, but rather as godlyneſſe requireth, to referre all thynges to the wil of God. This wil, if it be expreſſed in holy ſcripture, then may we ſimplye determine y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which we read expreſſed there. But if it be not ſo, then ought we frely to confeſſe our ignoraunce, and not preſcribe to God what he ought to doe of hys workes, by that which alreadye he hath done. God is of power infinite &amp; of nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g did he not only make al things, but alſo will doe what pleaſeth him both in heauen and in earth, ſayth Dauid.</p>
               <p>The foreſayd Thomas bringeth forth alſo other reaſons, but which he hym ſelfe counteth not for inuincible. One is, if beaſtes and plantes ſhall bee reſtored, eyther all or ſome ſhall be reſtored. If al ſhal be reſtored, then muſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate vnto them, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame in nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: which is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. If ſome ſhal be reſtored, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:9364:253"/>
no reaſon why theſe ſhoulde be reſtored more then other: therefore ſaith he, they ſhal not be reſtored. But here, what would he aunſwere, if one ſhoulde aſke him howe he knoweth it is not conuenient that eyther al in number bee reſtored, as ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal aryſe, eyther only ſome, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thys thing wholye reſteth in the hand and wil of God? An other reaſon he maketh out of Ariſtotle, and out of a grounde whiche is vncertayne. Ariſtotle affyrmeth the perpetuitie of thinges to hang on the continual mouing of heauen. Thomas now hereto gathereth thus: but the mouing of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhall ceaſe: therfore he concludeth that in theſe inferiour things no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuitie maye be looked for. But here, what anſwere wil he make, if a man ſhall ſay that all thynges hange at the becke and pleaſure of God, who nowe for the conſeruation of his creatures, whiche now aryſe and ſpring, and nowe dye and fall downe: vſeth the mouyng of heauen, and can after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes not vſe it for thys purpoſe? Thys is a truth, that all thynges of them ſelues are nothyng: muche more then can they not doe any thyng. Now, men may coniecture that the mouyng of heauen ſhall ceaſe, but yet by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> certaine word of God, they can not proue it. In like manner is hys laſte reaſon which he maketh of the ende of beaſtes and plantes, but which end he knoweth not. Beaſtes and plantes ſayth he, were made for the ſuſtentation of the mutual life of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but thys lyfe ſhall ceaſe, therefore ſhall they alſo. But here hath he no aunſweare if a man ſhoulde demaunde, who knoweth whether GOD haue made them to none other ende or vſe?</p>
               <p>Seing therfore theſe thynges be as you ſee, I ſuppoſe it not to pertayne to a godly man, to denye the beaſtes and pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes to be reſtored, in that the Apoſtle doth here expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, that euery creature which is now ſubiecte to vanitie, ſhal bee deliuered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of god. In that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoſt doth affirme thys of euery creature, by what reaſon dare a godly mind exempt any part fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this deliuerance to come? Howbeit, neyther wyll y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Godlye mynde contende whether euery creature ſhalbe renewed. For the holy ghoſt ſpake of the creature generally, and not perticulerly, and therfore we maye not otherwyſe affirme, becauſe we muſte not ſpeake
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:9364:253"/>
but gods worde. Therfore it is the parte of a godlye man, and of one that hangeth in all thynges vppon the worde of god, to learne out of thys place, that whatſoeuer corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, deathe, or griefe he ſeeth in anye thyng, whereſoeuer it bee, that (I ſaye) he aſcribe that wholye vnto hys ſynnes, and thereby prouoke hymſelfe to true repentaunce. Nowe as ſoone as that repentaunce compelleth hym to goe to Chriſte, lette hym thynke thus: but thys my Sauiour, and my head Ieſus Chriſt dyd for my ſynnes, and therewith, as he toke away death, ſo hath he taken away all the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and labour of all thynges, and wyll reſtore them in his tyme, whether ſo euer they be in heauen or in earthe. Now euery creature trauayleth and groneth wyth vs, but we be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>yng reſtored, they alſo ſhalbe reſtored. There ſhall be newe heauens, newe earth, and all thynges newe,</p>
               <p>Thus I wyſhe that our myndes myght ſtaye in thys generalitye of the renouation of the worlde, and not curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to ſearche what partes of the worlde ſhalbe reſtored, and what ſhall not, or how al thyngs ſhalbe reſtored: much more then I would not haue vs curious nor inquiſitiue of theyr place where they ſhall be, of theyr action what they ſhall doe, or of theyr properties and ſuche lyke. For if, to haue fore knowen theſe thynges, woulde haue made muche to godlines, ſurely the holy ghoſt woulde moſte playnely haue tolde them. For accordyng to chriſtes promiſe he brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vs into all truth, all truth (I ſaye) ſuche as the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it would profite vs. Al the ſcripture is geuen to vs for this purpoſe that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man of god might be made perfect, and enſtructed to al good workes: and truely that can be no good worke, which we do, except god teach vs the ſame.

Theſe be thynges of the lyfe to come, wherof thys foreknowledge is ſufficient that all theſe thynges ſhall be more perfect and happy, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the reach of reaſon is hable to loke vpon the glory of them.

               <p>As concerning the holye and reuerente ſacramentes of Chriſtes Church, whiche be in number .ii. the Sacramente of baptiſeme and the Supper of the Lord, I beleue them to be as Saint Paule calleth them, confyrmations or ſeales of Gods promiſes, whiche haue added to them a promyſe of grace, and therefore they are called inuiſible ſignes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible grace. The Sacramente of baptiſme is a marke of Chriſtes Churche, a ſeale and confirmation of oure accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the grace and fauour of God, for Chriſtes ſake. For hys innocencye, hys ryghteouſneſſe, hys holyneſſe, hys iuſtyce is ours, geuen vs of God: and our ſynnes and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryghteouſneſſe, by hys obedience and abaſing of hymſelfe to the death of the croſſe, are hys, whereof baptiſme is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſigne, ſeale, and confirmation. Baptiſme is alſo a ſigne of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce, to teſtifye that we be borne to the waues of perilles, and chaunges of lyfe, to the entent that we ſhoulde dye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuallye, as longe as we liue, from ſinne, and ryſe agayne like new men vnto ryghteouſneſſe. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. The other ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is the Supper &amp; holy maundy of our Sauiour Chriſt, wherby y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church of Chriſt is knowen, I beleue it is a remembraunce of Chriſtes death &amp; paſſion, a ſeale &amp; confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his moſt precious body geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto death, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vile death of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> croſſe, wherwith we are redemed &amp; deliuered from ſynne death, hel &amp; damnation.

ſo thys Sacramente, is a meane to the eyes, whereby the holy ghoſte moueth the harte to beleue: it preacheth peace betwene God and man, it exhorteth to mutuall loue and all godly life, and teacheth to contemne the world for the lyfe to come, when as Chriſte ſhal appeare, which now is in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; no where els as concernyng thys humaine body.<note place="margin">

<pb n="526" facs="tcp:9364:273"/>
it be good or bad. Therfore whatſoeuer we do, we may not bring the ſpirit in bondage to the body, but contrariwiſe we muſt ſubdue the body and the will of the fleſh to the ſpirite, that the ſpirit may freely accompliſhe the will of God in all thinges: for otherwiſe we ſhall neuer bee partakers of his promiſe, with the true children of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For as S. Paule ſaith, they which are the children of the fleſh, are not the chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of god: if we ſhal liue according to the fleſh, we ſhal die. For to be carnally minded, is deth: but to be ſpiritually min<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded, is life and peace, becauſe that the fleſhly mynded is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of god: for it is not obedient to the lawe of God, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can be. So then they that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God. Nowe choſe you which way you wil take, either the narrow way that leadeth vnto life, which chriſt himſelf and his faithful folowers haue gone through before: or els the broad path way that leadeth to deſtruction, which the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked worldlings take their pleaſure in for a while. I for my part haue now written this ſhort admonition vnto you of good wyl (as God be my witnes) to exhort you to that way which at length you your ſelues ſhould proue and finde to be beſt, yea and reioyce therof. And I do not onely write this, but I wil alſo (wyth the aſſiſtance of gods grace) ratify, confirme, and ſeale the ſame wyth the effuſion of my blood, when the full time ſhalbe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired that he hath appointed: which (ſo farforth as I maye iudge) muſte nedes be within theſe few dayes. Therfore I now byd you al moſt hartely farewel in the lord, whoſe grace be with your ſpirit, Amen. Watch &amp; pray, watch and pray, pray, pray. So be it.</p>

My aunſwere was, the Church of GOD knoweth and reknowledgeth no other heade but Ieſus Chriſte the ſonne of GOD, whom ye haue refuſed, and choſen the man of ſinne, the ſonne of perdition, enemye to Chriſt, the deuilles deputye and Lieuetenaunte the Pope. Chriſtes Churche heareth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 10</note> teacheth and is ruled by hys woorde, as he ſayeth: my ſheepe heare my voyce. If you abyde in me &amp; my worde in you, you be my Diſciples. Their churche repelleth gods worde, and forceth all men to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their traditions. Chriſtes Church dare not adde or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minyſhe, alter or chaunge his bleſſed teſtament: but they be not afrayde to take awaye all that Chriſt inſtituted, and goe a whoring (as the Scripture ſayeth) with their own inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>&amp; letari ſuper operibus manuum ſuarum,</hi> to glorye,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 7.</note> &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in the workes of their owne handes. The Churche of Chriſt is, hath bene and ſhalbe in all ages, vnder the croſſe, perſecuted, moleſted and afflicted, the world euer hating the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> becauſe they be not of the worlde. But theſe perſecute, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſlaye, &amp; kill ſuch as profeſſe the true doctrine of Chriſt, be they in learning, liuing, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſation, &amp; other vertues, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo excellent. Chriſt and his Church reſerued the tryal of their doctrine to the word of god,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.</note> and gaue the people leaue to iudge therof by the ſame word ſearch the ſcriptures. But thys Churche taketh awaye the woorde from the people,
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:9364:275"/>
and ſuffer neyther learned, nor vnlearned to examine or proue their doctryne by the woord of God. The true Church of God laboureth by all meanes to reſyſte and withſtande the luſtes, deſyres, and motions of the worlde, the fleſh and the deuyll. Theſe for the moſte part, geue themſelues to all voluptuouſneſſe, and ſecretlye commit ſuche thinges, whiche (as Saint Paule ſayeth) it is ſhame to ſpeake of.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ephe.</hi> 5.</note> By theſe and ſuche like manifeſt probations, they do declare themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to be none of the Churche of Chriſte, but rather of the Sinagoge of Sathan. It ſhall be good for you oftentymes to conferre and compare theyr proceedynges and doinges, with the practyſe of thoſe whom the woorde of God doth teache to haue bene true members of the Churche of God, and it ſhall woorke in you both knowledge, erudition, and boldneſſe to withſtand wyth ſufferyng, their doings. I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them therfore to Nemrod, whom the Scripture calleth a mightye hunter or a ſtoute champion, telling them that that which they coulde not haue by the worde, they would haue by the ſworde, and be the Church whether men wil or no, and called them wyth good conſcience, as Chriſt called their forefathers, the children of the deuil: and as their father the deuyll is a lyer and murtherer, ſo their kyngdome and church (as they call it) ſtandeth by lying and murtheryng.</p>
               <p>Haue no fellowſhyppe with them therfore, my deare wife, with their doctrine, and traditions, leaſt you be perta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of their ſynnes: for whom is reſerued a heuye dampna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wythoute ſpedye repentaunce. Beware of ſuch as ſhall aduertyſe you ſomethyng to beare with the worlde as they do, for a ſeaſon. There is no dallying with Gods matters: it is a fearefull thynge (as Saincte Paule ſayeth) to fall into the handes of GOD. Remember the Prophet Heli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as:<note place="margin">3. <hi>Regu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> 18 <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.</note> why halte ye on both ſydes?

               <p>If I woulde haue geuen place to worldlye reaſons, theſe myght haue moued me.

firſt ſight of the Sherife, nature a little abaſhed: yet or euer I came to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pryſon, by the working of god and through his goodnes feare departed. I ſayd to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sherife at his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng vnto me: what matter haue you Maiſter Sherife to charge me withal? He anſwered, you ſhal know when you come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Maiſters. And ſo takyng me w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him, I loked to haue bene brought before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Maiſters, &amp; to haue heard what they could haue burdened me withal. But co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to my expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted fortwith to the Iayle not being called to my anſwere, litle iuſtice being ſhewed therin. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leſſe iuſtice a man findeth at their hands, the more conſolation in conſcience ſhal he fynde from God: for whoſoeuer is of the world, the world will loue hym. After I came into priſon &amp; had repoſed my ſelf there a whyle, I wept for ioye and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe my belly ful, muſing much of the great mercies of god, and (as it were) ſaying to my ſelfe after thys ſorte: O Lorde who am I, on whom thou ſhouldeſt beſtowe thus thy great mercy, to be numbred among the Saintes that ſuffer for thy Goſpels ſake? And ſo beholding and conſidering on the one ſide my imperfection, vnableneſſe, ſinnefull miſery, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthyneſſe, and on the other ſide the greatneſſe of Gods mercy, to be called to ſo hygh a promotion: was as it were, amaſed and ouercome for a whyle with ioye and gladneſſe, concluding thus with my ſelf in my hart: O Lord y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> ſheweſt power in weakeneſſe, wyſedome in foliſheneſſe, mercye in ſinnefulneſſe, who ſhall let thee to chooſe where and whom thou wilte? As I haue zelouſlye loued the confeſſion of thy worde, ſo euer thoughte I my ſelf to be moſt vnworthy to be pertaker of the affliction for the ſame,</p>
               <p>Not long after, came vnto me Maiſter. W. Braſbryge, Maiſter C. Phinees, Maiſter N.

For as muche as the Maiſters haue impryſonned me, hauyng nothynge to burdeine me with all, if I ſhoulde enter into bondes, I ſhoulde in ſo doinge accuſe my ſelfe. And ſeing they haue no matter to laye to my charge, they maye aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well lette me paſſe wythoute bondes, as with bondes. Secondarelye, if I ſhall enter bondes, couenaunte, and

I ſayde vnto them I hadde caſte my penyworthe, by Gods helpe. They vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertoke alſo to make the bonde eaſie. And when they were ſomewhat importune, I ſayd to Maiſter Hopkins that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertye of conſcience was a precious thyng, and tooke as it were a pauſe, lifting vppe my harte to God earneſtlye for hys ayde and helpe that I mighte doe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing that mighte pleaſe hym. And ſo, when they had let their ſute fall, my harte, me thoughte, was wonderfullye comforted. Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Dudlye commoned wyth me in lyke manner: whom I aunſweared in effecte as I dyd before. Afterwarde debatinge the matter with my ſelfe, theſe conſiderations came to my head: I haue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tyme to tyme w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience (God I take to recorde) moued all ſuche as I hadde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with all, to be no daliers in Gods matters, but to ſhewe them ſelues after ſo greate a lyghte and knowledge, hartye, earneſt, conſtante, and ſtable in ſo manifeſt a truth, and not to geue place one iote contrarye to the ſame. Nowe thoughte I, if I ſhall withdrawe my ſelfe, and make anye ſhiftes to pull my own necke out of the collor, I ſhall geue great offence to my weake brethren in Chriſte, and aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the enemyes to ſlaunder Gods woorde. It will be ſayd, he hath bene a greate boldner of others to be earneſt &amp; feruent to feare no worldly perills or daungers, but he him ſelf wil geue no ſuche example.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I thoughte it my bounden dutye both to God and man, being (as it were) by the greate goodneſſe of GOD. maruelouſlye called and appoynted hereunto, to ſette aſyde all feare, perilles, and daungers, all worldlye reſpectes and conſiderations, and lyke as I hadde hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, accordyng to the meaſure of my ſmall gifte, wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſe of my vocation &amp; callyng, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bottome of my hart vnfaynedly moued, exhorted, &amp; perſuaded al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> profeſſed gods word, manfully to perſiſte in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> defence of the ſame, not wyth ſword &amp; vyolence, but wyth ſufferyng and loſſe of life,

rather then to defyle themſelues agayne with the whoryſhe abhomination of the Romyſh Antichriſt: ſo the houre being come, wyth my facte and example to ratifye, confyrme, and proteſte the ſame to the hartes of all true beleuers: &amp; to this end (by the myghtye aſſiſtance of Gods holy ſpirite) I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued my ſelf wyth much peace of conſcience, willingly to ſuſtayne what ſoeuer the Romyſhe Antichriſt ſhould doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſte me, and the rather becauſe I vnderſtoode the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes comming to be at hande, and conſidered that poore mens conſciences ſhoulde be then ſharpely aſſaulted. So re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned I pryſoner in Couentrye by the ſpace of .10. or .11. daies, being neuer called to my anſwere of the Maiſters, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye to the lawes of the Realme, they hauyng neither ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, lawe, proclamation, letter, warrante, nor commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement for my apprehenſion. They would haue layed al the matter vpon the Summer. Who being examined, denyed it before theyr faces, as one of my frendes told me, ſaying: that he had no comaundemente concerning me, but for my elder brother. God lay not their extreme doinges agaynſte me, to their charge at the great day.</p>
               <p>The ſecond day after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> biſhops coming to Couentry, M. Warren came to the Yeldhaule, &amp; willed the chiefe Iayler to cary me to the Byſhop. I layed to M.

And ſo he parted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me ſaying, I nede not to feare, If I wold be of his beliefe. God open hys eyes if it be his will, and geue hym grace to beleue thys, which he &amp; all of hys inclination, ſhall finde (I feare) to true for their partes: that is, that all they whiche cruelly, maliciouſly, and ſpytefully perſecute, moleſt &amp; afflict the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <pb n="535" facs="tcp:9364:277"/>When I came before the Byſhop in one Dentons houſe, he began wyth this proteſtation, that he was my biſhop for for lacke of a better, and willed me to ſubmit my ſelfe.

If you ſaye blacke is whyte (my lord) muſt I alſo ſay as you ſaye, and beleue the ſame becauſe you ſay it is ſo? M. Chauncelour noted me to be arrogant, becauſe I would not geue place to my byſhop.

               <p>On the Friday mornyng beyng the next day after, I had warning by one of the priſoners to prepare my ſelfe to ride wyth my fellow priſoners the ſame day to Lychfield, there to be beſtowed at the biſhops pleaſure.

to preuayle agaynſt vs. wyth ſuch lyke meditations, I waxed chereful and of good conſolation and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort.

hys offyce wyth mercy, tellyng hym that they ſhoulde haue iudgement wythout mercy, that ſhewed no mercy. And this mercy I founde at hys hand. He put me into a pryſon the ſame nyght, where I continued vntyll I was condemned, a place next to the doungel, narrow of roumes, ſtrong of buil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dyng, and very cold, wyth ſmall lyght: and there alloweth he me a bundel of ſtraw in ſtead of my bed, wythout chaire, forme or any thyng els to eaſe my ſelfe wythall. God of his mercy gaue me great patience through prayer that nyghte, ſo that if it had bene hys pleaſure, I could haue bene co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to haue ended my life. But Iephcot and one Perſey the biſhops man, whyche afterwardes was my continuall ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the moſt part, came to me in the mornyng: to whome I ſaid this is great extremity, god ſend vs patience, and no more. Then they were content that I ſhould haue a bedde of myne owne procurement.

               <p>Within two daies after. M. Chauncellour and one Temſey a prebendary there, came to me into my priſon. M. Chauncellor exhorted me to conforme my ſelfe to my Lord and to the church.

Now thus the ſecond tyme, I aunſwered M. Chauncellour to hys exhortation, that I refuſed not to be ruled by that church that was content to be ordered and gouerned by the worde of GOD. He aſked me how I knewe the worde of God, but by the churche. The churche ſheweth whiche is the word of god, therfore the church is aboue the word of God. This is no good reaſon in learnyng, ſayd I to May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cellor. For it is like vnto this: Iohn ſhewed the people who was Chriſt, <hi>Ergo</hi> Iohn was aboue Chriſte. Or els, I haue a man that knoweth not the king, and I tel him who is the kyng, am I therfore aboue the kyng? M. Chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour ſaid he came not to reaſon with me, and ſo departed. So remained I without any further conference of any man by the ſpace of <hi>.8.</hi> dayes, and tyll the biſhops commyng: in

               <p>Ah my dere hartes, what ſhal I ſay to you, or how ſhall I temper my pen to perſuade you? Al the godly preachers that in tymes paſt haue taken paines amongeſt you, haue fully agreed and wholy concluded, yea and by the holy ſcriptures plainly proued, that it is not lawful for any of you to be per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſonally preſent with the papiſtes at any part of their Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeruice.

Yea many a faithful hart hath folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and to their power done the lyke, and yet (alas) all wil not now ſerue.

I doe not perſuade you to abſente your ſelfe from anye place where your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of neceſſity is requyred, for in all ſuch places, I know, GOD will preſerue you, as he hath hetherto wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye done, prayſed be his name therefore: or if it ſhal pleaſe him to permitte you in any ſuch place to bee taken, I know he will moſte ſweetelye comforte your conſcience with this conſideration, that it is the verye prouidence and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente of GOD that you ſhoulde there and then bee taken vppe for a witneſſe of hys truth vnto the worlde: but I can not allowe you, nor bee contented that you ſhoulde raſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye or negligentlye thruſte your ſelfe into that place where your wicked enemies doe continually haunte, yea and laye waite for you, when no neceſſitie of your ſelfe nor of anye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Gods people doth require your companye. Yf they neede anye of your Godlye counſell, you maye write vnto them that thing that you thinke good: whiche, I dare ſaye, will be ſufficient vnto them. For (continuall thankes and prayſes bee geuen vnto the euerlaſting God) there is none of thoſe that be cruellye condemned for Gods truth, that now be weakelings: for they haue manfully paſſed through the pikes, and they haue boldely abidden the brunte of the battel, and therfore I recken y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worſt is paſt w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alreadie.

For in a glaſſe that is cleere, a ſmall mote wil ſone appeare: euen ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good conſcience of Gods choſen children being more cleere then Chriſt all, wil quickely accuſe them at the leaſt faulte they do commit, where as the wicked worldlings haue their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence clogged and corrupted throughe the cuſtome of ſinne, that they can not once ſee nor perceaue their owne ſhameful deedes and wicked workes, vntil GOD ſet the ſame before them for their vtter deſtruction, and then diſpayre they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly.

And where as you do require to know my ſimple minde concerning your aunſweare vnto Doctor Storye and the Chauncelour: tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye I ſaye you did aunſweare them very well: for there are but two Sacramentes in deede: that is to ſaye, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Baptiſme, and the Sacrament of the bodye and bloode of Chriſte, as you haue full well aunſweared them: prayſed be God for hys good giftes, who choſeth the weake to confounde the ſtronge, and the foolyſhe to confounde the worldlye wyſe.

yea or naye, to all ſuche thinges as they haue to charge you with all, whiche they haue gathered of you ſince you came into their cruell handes. But if they will needes make manye woordes with you, becauſe you are but a ſimple man, and therefore perchaunce they will be the buſier with you to ttouble you with manye queſtions to comber your knowledge, and then ſeeme to triumphe ouer you and that truth that you doe holde: if (I ſaye) they doe thys, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happes for ſome euill purpoſe they will: then bee you ſo plaine and ſhorte as you can, ſaying roundlye vnto them theſe or ſuche lyke woordes as nyghe as you can.

In reſpecte whereof, I truſt you do not onely caſte al your care vpon him: but alſo moſt louingly obeye him in all his holy ordinaunces, euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more meekely ſubmitting your will vnto his in all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing: knowing that the ſame wil make all thinges turne to your beſte, and that without his pleaſure, a poore ſparow ſhall not peryſhe in the foulers nette: muche leſſe you, or your deare huſband, your good Vncle M. Latymer or any of yours. Let this fayth and godlye perſuaſion, euer more be firme in your hart without doubting or wauering: for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Therefore let this be your alone and continual endeuour, to be confirmed more and more of this, that GOD is your owne moſte deare louing father throughe Chriſt, that he hath a moſte tender care ouer you, and for you, as alwayes he hath hadde and euer wyll haue,

And as you prayſe the Lord for his great mercyes &amp; manifolde benefites ſo largelye geuen vnto you before many other: ſo do you faythfully pray vnto him, that he wil continue hys louing kindnes towards you, and kepe you blameleſſe through loue in Chriſt, vnto the ende: yea &amp; make you worthye, ſtronge, and able, to ſuffer the loſſe of your owne life for the teſtimonye of his truth: whiche (as your good Vncle ſayde to me once, and your deare huſband full often) is the greateſt promotion and dignitie that God can bring vs vnto in this life, yea it is an honour which the higheſt Aungells in heauen be not permitted to haue. And in this your hartye and faythfull prayer, I doe moſte hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blye require you to remember me a moſte miſerable wretch, I feare me, not compted worthye to become one of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtante witneſſes vnto the worlde in ſuch ſorte as I woulde fayne be: pray for me my deare hart, pray for me, as I will neuer forgette you nor your bleſſed childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo long as I am in this priſon of the body. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mende me vnto Hewgh Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, Marmaduke, and to their younger brother and ſiſter. The Lord god comfort and bleſſe them, and poure his good ſpirite vpon them, wherewith their good father was plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully endewed.

I haue manye thinges to ſay more, but I am here conſtrayned to make an end. Al my doinges come to an ende with extremitie. God graunt that I may enter into his glory through the ſtraite gate, though I ſtruggle &amp; ſtriue, thruſting amonge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preaſſe with great violence.

            <p>I thanke you for my cap, I am ſomthing proud of it, for it is one ſteppe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cleargy in theſe dayes. I thank god, my harte is cleane deuided from their proceedings. For I know y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can ſerue .ij. Maiſters, ſpecially if they agree no better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt &amp; Antichriſt do. I am glad that Hadley can ſkil of ſuch packing ware, as was brought thether y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fyrſt day of May laſt paſt. Chriſtes ſhepe ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diſcerne chriſts voice fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the voyce of ſtraungers, theues or hyrelings. The packe bringer was ſory y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he came to late to the funeral market of hys faythfull frend. But here I wil leaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both to Gods iudgement, &amp; ſometing touche y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter wherof the packer made mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on his opening day. At y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt he called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (as I heare) ful of darke ſentences, but in dede it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of S. Dauid, a candle to our fete, &amp; a light to our pathes. Our Sauiour Chriſte calleth his word y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> light, which euyll doers do flye fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; hate, leſt their dedes ſhould be reproued therby. S. Paul wold haue vs to walke as childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of light, &amp; in any wiſe not to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue in ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or darknes. But al we in the world perteyn to .ij. princes: eyther to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father of light &amp; truth, or els to the prince of darknes &amp; lyes. In theſe dayes preachers declare euidently of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are ſent, and w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what ſpirit they ſpeake, &amp; to what prince they belong: For they cry out againſte Gods lightes, ſunne, moone, ſterres, torches, lampes, lanternes, creſſets, &amp; ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dels in gods booke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Bible, prouided of gods great goodnes &amp; mercy, to auoyd al foule darknes, cloudes, &amp; miſtes or daungerous doubtful waies in this our iourney to our heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly father, long home, manſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> houſes, &amp; derely purchaſed heritage.

Therfore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth my people into captiuitie, becauſe they haue no vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng. Our ſauiour Chriſt pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth errours &amp; hereſyes to remaine amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the people, ſo long as ignorance of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcriptures remaineth. And hereby it appeareth to al good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences, what they meane,
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:9364:331"/>
which defame or accuſe gods bleſſed word being ful of light, as though it were ful of darknes. Theſe oules wold haue al day lightes ſcraped out of bokes, harts, &amp; churches. Oh lord, turne their hartes &amp; tonges: bowe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the way of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, leſt they go to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince of darknes, &amp; be caſt into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of vtter darknes, where is weping &amp; gnaſhing of teeth.</p>
            <p>Now, touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> packes of wolle, &amp; packes of cloth, I feare they were, as al other their wares be, tranſſubſtantiate into flockes, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his very fineſt packing ſtuffe againſt only fayth iuſtifying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; for the corporal preſence of Chriſtes body in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, for praying for ſoules departed, &amp; for auriculer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And Abrahams works of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in offring vp his ſonne ſo long after his iuſtification, muſt nedes be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as a fruit of a good tree iuſtifying before men, &amp; not of iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before god: for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye in: then did Chriſt die in vaine. And where as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> .6. chap. of S. Iohn was alleaged, to proue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chriſt did geue his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy corporally in his ſupper, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he had promiſed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaid 6. chap. it is moſt vntrue. For only he gaue his body ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, ſpiritually &amp; effectually in his ſupper to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Apoſtles, and corporally he gaue it in a bloody ſacrifice for the life of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the croſſe once for al. There in his own perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in his own natural body, he bare al our ſines: by whole ſtripes we were healed, as S. Peter proueth. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. &amp; <hi>Eſay cap</hi> 53. In dede, receauing Chriſts ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t accordi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as it was inſtituted, we receaue Chriſtes body &amp; Chriſts blood, euen as I ſayd before the Apoſtles dyd.

O Lorde god, heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for Chriſtes ſake, we beſech thee to turne againe Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to the right way it was in, in King Edwardes tyme, from thys babilonicall ſtewyſhe ſpirituall whoredome, conſpiracye, tyranny, deteſtable enormityes, falſe doctrine, hereſye, hardneſſe of hart, and contempte of thy worde &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>Therefore, we knowing the greate and lamentable loſſe whiche we doe ſuſtaine in Adam, ought moſte earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſeeke the recouerye thereof, that we mighte eternallye liue like vnto God in immortalitie and felicitie: the whiche we ſhall neuer recouer, vnleſſe we goe aboute to mortifye our outwarde man all the dayes of our life more and more, and bee renewed in ſpirite, according to the true knowledge of GOD: the whiche if we bee, then may we bee aſſured that we haue found that ioye, felicitie, and eternall life, whiche Adam had in paradiſe, yea and more then that tenne thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand folde, for that it is ſuche as the eye hath not ſeene, the eare hath not heard, neither the hart ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceaue which chriſt

hath prepared for vs. This image of god, whoſoeuer by faith doth fynd, he hath found the moſt precious treaſure that any man can finde, for he is euen here a citizen of heauen, and in poſſeſſion of eternal life. Therefore I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit vnto you prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally a dailye care of the renouation of this image, as the chiefeſt iewel you can deſire in this world. And hereof now I am the more moued to put you in remembraunce, becauſe I loue you entierly in the lord, and deſyre your fellowſhyp, which the iniquity of our tyme will not permit me to enioy here. And for aſmuche as we haue a better life to come then this preſent is, an eternall ſocietie w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt, whiche neyther the malice of tyme, neither the diſtance of place can diſſolue or ſeparate: I exhort you now as one y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath obtained mercy of god in the reparacion of hys image in me, to embrace the care therof, with earneſt deſyre to attayn y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame, wherby we ſhal al haue a perfect fruition of our loue &amp; frendſhip, which alreadye we haue here begon, &amp; with god in heauen ſhalbee (wythout all doute) made ioyfully perfect.</p>
            <p>Let this be a perpetual remembrance of your poore afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted frend, which daily loketh through fire, to enter into that eternal life, where he truſteth aſſuredly to enioy your fellow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhip, if the image of god be renued in you through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt, which you haue receyued &amp; do know. Loke whoſe image the coyne beareth, his it is. Semblably, if your conuerſation be after the goſpell, verely you are the elect of Chriſt: but if it be according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, his ſeruants you are whom your lyfe doth expreſſe. We haue all in Baptiſme put on Chriſt, whom if we endeuour to repreſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, we are in dede the ſonnes of God and inheritours wyth Chriſt. One good rule S. Paule to the Rom. in the xij. chap. doth appoint for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſtauration of this our image of God. Faſhion not your ſelues (ſaith he) vnto thys world, but be ye chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged in your ſhape, by the renewyng of your mynde, that ye maye proue what is the will of god, which thing is good, acceptable &amp; perfect.

purpoſe, then to blynde your eyes that they mighte not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the things which be glorious and permanent for euer. The thynges whiche we ſee, are mortall: but the thynges which we ſee not but certainly hope for, be immortall. For all fleſh, as the Prophete Eſay ſaythe, is but graſſe, and the glory therof as the flower of the fielde. Oh that you whiche haue the poſſeſſions of thys world, would ſo accompt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; not ſel your eternal inheritance for a meſſe of porrige, as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau dyd. God open your eyes that you may ſee the glory of Chriſt in the mount wyth Peter, Iohn, and Iames. Then I doubte not, you would ſay with Peter. Lord it is good for vs to abyde here: let vs here make our dwelling places. We haue in this world no fyrme manſion, but we ſeke after that which is to come: the which yf we ſeke nowe where it maye be found, we ſhal ſurely finde it. If we mortify the image of Adam, which through ſynne raigneth in our fleſh, then ſhal the image of Chriſt reuiue in vs to our eternall glorye. We are all baptiſed to die wyth Chriſte, to the ende we ſhoulde walke in newnes of lyfe as perſons dead to the world, and liuyng to God. And if we dye with hym by crucifieng our concupiſcence and luſtes, we ſhall eternally lyue. Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe of all our miſery: which cauſeth vs to feare ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more then GOD, and to eſteme the thynges preſence more then the thynges to come. God illighten our eyes that we may vnderſtand how precious an inheritaunce Chriſt hath prepared for ſuche as hunger and thurſt therafter. Then I doubte not we would ſay wyth Sayncte Paule, I am ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſuaded that neyther deathe nor lyfe, neyther Aungels nor rule, neyther power, neyther thynges preſent, neyther thynges to come, neyther anye other treaſure, or creature, ſhall ſeparate vs from the loue whych is in Chriſte Ieſus. The Lorde encreaſe our fayth, and geue vs hys holy ſpirite to diſcerne wyth our ſelues, howe muche we are growen in hys image, and are lyke vnto hym: for howe muche we are vnlyke to the worlde, ſo muche more are we like vnto god, and ſo much the more do we approche vnto hym. The lord drawe you by hys holye ſpirite, and faſhion you vnto hys lykenes, that we may eternally lyue together. The meanes
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:9364:335"/>
to come therevnto, is diligent exerciſe in gods worde: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall and faithfull prayer: a deſyre and loue to GOD: the feare of God: the contempte of the worlde: and a conſtant faythe in the knowledge of hys worde, ioyned wyth the workes of righteouſnes.</p>
            <p>This is the Summe of all our chriſtian religion which we doe profeſſe: which yf we followe, happy are we that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer we were borne. But if we be negligent in thys, it had bene better for vs neuer to haue bene borne: for curſed are they that declyne from the Lorde and hys holye commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes, and haue their delyghtes in the vanities of thys worlde. Ceaſe not to followe the image of God, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the ſame in your ſelues to the glory of god, and then god wil glorify you for his image ſake, which he ſaith to liue in you. We are all weake in tranſformyng the ſame in vs at the begynnyng: for our fleſhe is cleane contrary to it. But we muſt not geue ouer by lawfullye ſtriuyng, tyl we maye ſay wyth Saint Paule, now lyue I, but not I, but Chryſte in me. The Lorde graunt that Chriſt, whiche by the goſpell is planted in vs, may be faſhioned in our godly conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the glorye of God, and to the good example of oure brethren, that our temporall lyfe maye be chaunged into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall lyfe, and oure frendeſhyppe in God, eternallye en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, Amen.</p>

You report me to my face that I am a great ſlaunder to the church of God: which maye be two wayes vnderſtand, that is by lyuyng &amp; doctryne. But as for liuing you your ſelues (I thanke god therfore) gaue teſtimonye with me. In doctrine therefore you meane it. Now, in that there be many partes of the doctrine of chriſt, I trow you meane not generally, but perticulerly: for you in generalitie haue diuers tymes geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your commendation on my behalfe, both to my face and behynd my backe: for the which I hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bly prayſe my god, through Chriſt. In perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laritie therfore you meane that I am a ſlaunder: which (as farre as I know) is onely in thys to you wardes, that I be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leue and affirme the ſaluation of gods children to be ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, that they ſhall aſſuredly enioy the ſame. You ſaye it hangeth partely vpon our perſeueraunce to the ende: and I ſay it hangeth onely and altogether vppon gods grace in Chriſt, and not vpon our perſeueraunce in any pointe: for then were grace no grace.<note place="margin">

<pb n="651" facs="tcp:9364:336"/>
do otherwiſe. For if perſeueraunce be not a cauſe, but onely gods grace in Chriſt the whole and only cauſe of ſaluation: then the cauſe, that is to ſay grace remaining, the thing, that is to ſay ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, cannot but remayne alſo. Of which thing, if wyth the ſcriptures you woulde make perſeueraunce an effect or fruite, then could you not be offended at the truth: but ſay as it ſaithe, that the ſaluation of gods chyldren is ſo certayne, that they ſhall neuer finally periſhe, the lorde put<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting his hand vnder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that if they fal, yet they ſhal not lie ſtil. For whom he loueth, he leaueth not,<note place="margin">Iohn. 13.</note> but loueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the ende: ſo that perſeueraunce is proper to them and dothe diſcerne them from hypocrites, and ſuch as ſeme to other &amp; to themſelues alſo ſometymes, that they bee gods children. Which if they once were in dede, then as S. Iohn ſaith, they ſhold not ſinne the ſinne to death,<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 3.5 1. Iohn. 2. Heb. <hi>3.</hi>
               </note> neither ſhold they go out of gods church, but as Paule ſayth, ſhoulde perſeuer to the ende. Now to be gods child, is no leſſe in al pointes aboue the power of man, then to be mans child, is aboue our own power: but ſo much it paſſeth our habililie in all pointes to be gods child, by how much thys dignity is greater. Again, once gods childe in deede, and gods childe for euer: that is, finally ſhall not he that is ſo, periſh eternally, if that god our father be both of good wyll infinite, and alſo of power accordyngly: and yf the ſede of god which remaineth in hys chyldren,<note place="margin">1.

For where no law is, there is no tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſgreſſion (tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion I ſay to fynall damnation) for the new couenaunt of god is, neuer to remember their ſynnes, but to geue them ſuch hartes &amp; mindes, that as they naturally luſt &amp; labour to do that is euil: ſo theyr inwarde man renewed, ſtriueth to the contrary, and at the length ſhall preuaile,<note place="margin">1.

            <p>This certainty and aſſuraunce, who ſo feeleth in himſelf by the teſtimony of gods ſprite: in dede and of truth, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:9364:337"/>
is happy for euer, and cannot but as he hopeth he ſhall bee lyke to Chriſt in hys comming, ſo deſire it, and purify hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in all puritie (ſo farre wyll he be from carnall libertye) and as the elect of God, he will endue and apparell hymſelf daily wyth the apparell of the elect, vſyng praier night and day: which is an other propertie of gods children. To thys certaintie, all the creatures of god cal vs, concernyng theyr creation and vſe. This aſſuraunce gods firſte commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment requireth vnder payne of dampnation: the goſpell of god and all hys promyſes: the ſacramentes &amp; the ſubſtance of them, which is Chriſt Ieſus our Sauiour, doth aboue al thyngs require it of euery one that is baptiſed and brought into gods churche. Nothing elles dothe GOD to require of vs, as thus to be perſuaded of him: for out of it floweth al godlines to god &amp; man. So that it cannot be but they take Satans part, which go about to let or hynde this certainty in themſelues and in others. The whiche thing in that you do in dede, howſoeuer you meane: I cannot but as I haue done often before, admoniſhe you of it efteſones, that your bloodes may be on your own heads, if you perſeuer in your obſtinacy, and yf you do it obſtinately and not ignorauntly.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Aiſter Cheke, I wiſh you grace and peace. Syr in Gods cauſe, for Gods ſake, and in his name, I beſech you of your helpe &amp; fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance towards gods word. I did talke with you of late what caſe I was in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning my Chaplens. I haue gotten the good will &amp; graunt to be with me, of three preachers, men of good learning, and (as I am perſwaded) of excellent vertue, whiche are able both with life and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to ſet forth Gods worde in London, and in the whole dioceſſe of the ſame, where is moſt nede of al partes in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande: for from thence goeth example (as you know) into al the reſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Kings Maieſties whole Realme. The mens names be theſe. M Grindall, whom you know to be a man of vertue and learning. M. Bradforde, a man by whom (as I am aſſuredlye enformed) God hath and doth woorke wonders, in ſetting forth of hys woorde. The thirde is a preacher the whiche for detecting and confuting of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſtes and papiſtes in Eſſex both by his preaching and by his writing, is enforced nowe to beare Chriſtes croſſe. The two firſt be Scholers in the Vniuerſitie. The thirde is as poore as either of the other twayne. Nowe, there is fallen a Prebende in Paules called Cantrelles, by the death of one Layton. Thys Prebend is an honeſt mans liuing of .xxxiiij. poundes, and better in the Kings bookes. I woulde with all my harte geue it vnto M. Grindall, and ſo I ſhould haue hym continuallye with me and in my dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, to preache.</p>
            <p>But Alas Syr, I am letted by the meanes (I feare me)
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:9364:354"/>
of ſuche as do not feare God. One M. William Thomas, one of the Clarkes to the Counſell, hath in tymes paſt ſette the Counſaile vpon me, to haue me to graunte that Layton mighte haue alienated the ſayde Prebend vnto him and his heires for euer. God was mine ayde and defendour, that I dyd not conſent vnto his vngodly enterpriſe. Yet I was ſo then handled before the Counſel, that I grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſoeuer it ſhould fall, I ſhoulde not geue it, before I ſhoulde make the Kinges Maieſtie preuye vnto it and of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> collation of it. Now Layton is departed, and the Prebend is fallen, &amp; certaine of the Counſell (no doubt, by this vngodly mans meanes) haue writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto me, to ſtay the collatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And where as he diſpaireth, that euer I would aſſent that a preachers liuing ſhoulde be beſtowed on hym: he hath procured letters vnto me, ſubſcribed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> certaine of the Counſelles hands, that now y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Kings Maieſtie hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined it vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> furniture of his highnes ſtable. Alas Syr, this is a heauy hearing. When papiſtrye was taught, there was nothing too litle for the teachers. When y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Biſhop gaue his benefices vnto idiotes, vnlearned, vngodlye, for kindred, for pleaſure, for ſeruice, &amp; other worldly reſpectes, all was then wel allowed. Now, where a poore liuing is to be geuen vnto an excellent Clarke, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knowen &amp; tryed to haue both diſcretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; alſo vertue, &amp; ſuch a one as before god, I do not know a man yet vnplaced &amp; vnprouided for, more meete to ſet forth gods word in al Englande: when a poore liuing (I ſay) which is founded for a preacher, is to be geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto ſuch a man, that then an vngodly perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal procure in this ſorte letters to ſtoppe &amp; lette the ſame, alas M. Cheke, this ſeemeth vnto me to be a ryght heauy hearing. Is thys the fruite of the goſpel? Speake M. Cheke, ſpeake for gods ſake, in gods cauſe, vnto whom ſoeuer you thinke you may do any good withall. And if you will not ſpeake, then I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſech you, let theſe my letters ſpeake vnto M. Gates, to M. Wrothe, to M. Cicill, whom all I doe take for men that doe feare God.</p>
            <p>It was ſayd here conſtantly, my Lord Chamberlaine to haue bene departed. Syr, though the day be delayed, yet he hath no pardon of long life, &amp; therfore I do beſech his good Lordſhip, &amp; ſo many as ſhall read theſe letters, if they feare
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:9364:354"/>
God, to helpe that neither horſe, neither yet dogge be ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to deuour y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore liuings appointed &amp; founded by god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordinance, to the miniſters of gods worde. The cauſes of conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which do moue me to ſpeake &amp; write thus, are not only thoſe whiche I declared once in the cauſe of this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend, before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Kings Maieſties Counſell, which now I let paſſe: but alſo now y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man M.

            <p>Wherfore for gods ſake, I beſech you al, helpe that with the fauour of the Counſel, I may haue knowledge of the kings maieſties good pleaſure, to geue thys preachers liuing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to M.

So that they are farre ouerſeene whyche thynke that the profeſſion of the goſpel, whiche the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll moſt enuieth, the world moſt hateth, &amp; the fleſh moſt repineth at, can be without a croſſe.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He grace of god be vnto you, wyth my harty com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mendations.</p>
            <p>I haue ſene the places, noted the doctrine and diſcipline, and talked wyth the learned men of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentine, Baſyll, Zurich, Berne, Lauſan, and Geneua,</hi> and I haue had experience in all theſe places, of ſyncere doctryne, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly order, and great learnyng, and eſpecially of ſuche vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous learning, diligence, and charitie in <hi>Bullinger</hi> at <hi>Zurich,</hi> and in <hi>Caluine</hi> at <hi>Geneua,</hi> as doth much aduaunce gods glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry, vnto the edifying of Chriſtes church with the ſame reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the which you be now in priſon. And as I dout not but you in readyng of their bookes, haue fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d much godly and comfortable knowledge, ſo I am ſure that they in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng of your conſtancy &amp; patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, take occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> greatly to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ioyce, wyth thankes geuing vnto God, whiche doth teſtifye his truth vnto the worlde, not onely by their writyng, but alſo by your ſuffering. The lord therefore, which vſeth thys your ſuffering ioyned wyth godly learnyng, to ſet forth his glory, not onely vnto the comfort of ſimple ſoules in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, but alſo vnto the great reioycing &amp; encouraging of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt godly learned men in al cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treis: wil (as I deſire and truſt) geue you ſuche comforte in conſcience, as ſhall eaſely beare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paines of your impriſonme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. If you deſire to ſuffer or do that thing whiche mighte teſtifye the truth, aduaunce the glory, &amp; edifye the church of Chriſt, truly you haue your deſire: yea and I enſure you, very many godlye men in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places, geue daily thankes vnto god in praier for you.</p>
            <p>You know your cauſe is good: your frendes be in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, &amp; your aduerſaries in diſpleaſure wyth the almightye god, your heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly father: your ſufferyng for the truth, ſhall not be vnrewarded: your hope in Chriſt ſhall neuer be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.

yet your teſtimony vnto the truth, ſhyneth farre abroad in the world, and your faythfull prayers in charitable vnitie, ioyned wyth many others, be continually preſented afore the throne of god. God graunt you grace to finde &amp; vſe comfortable meditation of his worde, in diligent obedience vnto hys wyl. Chriſt be your keper in comfort, Amen.</p>
